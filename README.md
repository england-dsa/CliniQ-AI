Last Updated March 2024.

Greetings. This repository was cloned from https://github.com/techwithtim/PythonAgentAI/tree/main and was optomized to work for MAC OS through VS Code. 


##### I personally had significant diffucties running this code as it is slightly outdated. Due to this, I have made straghtforward instructions on how I am able to run this code using MAC OS using VS code.

##### Instructions
- Clone the "CliniQ-AI" Repository
- In VS Code open a workspace with the cloned repository
- Open a terminal and input the following:
-   python3 -m venv ai
-   source ai/bin/activate
-   pip3 install pandas llama-index python-dotenv pypdf
- Run the main python script (python main.py)
