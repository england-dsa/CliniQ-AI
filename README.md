Hi everyone, currently working on the streamlit application for the project and I am getting output. However, I need help with two things:

- To imporve quality-of-life of the application, I would like store preivously submitted prompts and ai repsonses in the chat. I have tried and am having dificulty.
- On a very seperate note, why am i able to run app.py w/out my OPENAI API Key? (I think b/c llamamindex stuff but i want to be sure...

##### Instructions on cloning the repository and runing main.py
- Clone the "CliniQ-AI" Repository
- In VS Code open a workspace with the cloned repository
- Open a terminal and input the following:
-   python3 -m venv ai
-   source ai/bin/activate
-   pip3 install pandas llama-index python-dotenv
- Run the main python script (python main.py)

#### To run app.py
- pip3 install streamlit
- Run the app.py script using streamlit. (streamlit run app.py)
