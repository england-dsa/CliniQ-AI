6,72,NCT03657654,Not yet recruiting,Voice difficulty is a common complaint following thyroidectomy and while the procedure risks injury to laryngeal nerves involved in voice production voice difficulty is common even in the absence of evident injury to these nerves. The cause of voice change in these situations is not well defined and multiple mechanisms have been suggested. Some potential mechanisms include trauma to the laryngeal skeleton from intraoperative manipulation of the strap muscles cricothyroid muscle thyroid cartilage or trachea. However it is also possible that irritation due to intubation and edema to the neck and oral or pharyngeal soft tissues that develops after the surgery as a result of intubation plays a role in postoperative voice change. These mechanisms can occur in any operation requiring general endotracheal anesthesia even when the laryngeal nerves are not specifically at risk of injury. The purpose of this study is to evaluate voice outcomes after thyroidectomy (both objective and subjective patient and clinician reported) and compare those to voice outcomes after other surgeries that do not put the recurrent or superior laryngeal nerves at risk or traumatize the laryngeal skeleton but do require general endotracheal anesthesia. The primary assessment tool will be the Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10) which is a questionnaire that asks about the patient's interpretation of his/her voice quality and the impact it is having on daily activities. Data analysis will be done to see if participants have a significant change in their pre-operation VHI-10 score at approximately 1 week and 3 months post-operation. Additional assessments tools will include nasolaryngoscopy and nasolaryngeal stroboscopy to assess global vocal fold function Consensus Auditory Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) and computerized speech lab (CSL) acoustics to assess voice quality and vocal aerodynamic analysis to determine air flow through the larynx.,Thyroid Cancer;Thyroid Nodule,Thyroidectomy;Laryngeal Nerves;Voice problems,2019-12-15,,,Inclusion Criteria: 1.

11,102,NCT03655977,Not yet recruiting,"The standard treatment for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer includes a combination of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy (BT) with concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy. During the last decade the utilization of MRI for planning of EBRT and BT has grown based on the GEC ESTRO recommendations and the cervix is among the first cancer sites where response-adaptive radiotherapy has been successfully implemented in clinical practice. This approach has changed patterns of clinical practice with regard to dose administration and significant improvements in clinical outcome have been reported. However further development of both BT and EBRT is still demanded to improve tumor delineation and consequently local control. Recent developments in advanced image guidance for both EBRT and BT have potential to improve local as well as nodal and also systemic control. Multi-parametric PET/MR imaging potentially offers new possibilities for RT planning whereas a complete replacement of the planning MRI with combined PET/MRI for EBRT and BT alters target volume delineation due to superior soft tissue contrast provided by MRI and combined with the information of tumor heterogeneity perfusion characteristics and hypoxia provided by PET DW-MRI and DCE-MRI. However combined use of PET/MRI for treatment planning still remains challenging due to several aspects. Therefore investigators intend to encounter the technical challenges regarding dose planning and attenuation correction of MRI hardware and immobilization devices by generating Pseudo-CT using methods based on ultra-short echo time (UTE) MR sequence. Additionally investigators desire to assess how the complementary information provided by multi-parametric PET/MRI can affect the planning of EBRT and BT and contribute to better understanding of the pathology of cervical cancer during chemo-radiotherapy and improve radiation treatment. The PET/MR will be performed with a new PET-tracer ""RGD"" (68Ga-NODAGA- E[c(RGDyK)]2) enabling imaging of tumor-angiogenesis. This is to show the angiogenesis within the tumor and changes during external radiotherapy. The study of angiogenesis will be supported by examination of tissues from the tumor. Investigators expect the angiogenesis to correlate to the aggression and thereby the prognosis of the individual tumor.",Cervical Cancer,Cervical cancer;Treatment planning;PET/MRI imaging,2021-09-01,,Diagnostic,Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosed with cervical cancer stage - Tumor > 1cm - Referred for EBRT and BT planning - Age > 18 years - Informed consent Exclusion Criteria: - Prior RT of the pelvic region - Pregnancy and lactation - Claustrophobia - MR-incompatible implants,Female,,18 Years, ,facility:University Copenhagen|Copenhagen|2200|Denmark,Denmark,

13,111,NCT03652935,Completed,The Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program is designed to cultivate conscious awareness (i.e. mindfulness) of one's experience in a non-judgmental or accepting manner (Kabat-Zinn et al. 1990). Mindfulness programs may facilitate recovery from cancer. However most prior mindfulness investigations for women with breast cancer focused on cancer survivors well beyond the acute period of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Moreover few of these studies evaluated immune measures with relevance to cancer. Women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer (Stages 0 1 2 and 3) will be enrolled. Eligible women will be identified after completion of their breast surgery and when surgical pathology reports are available. Women will complete psychometric instruments and study questionnaires. They will provide blood for immune measures and saliva for cortisol diurnal rhythm. Measures will be done at five separate time points. These are pre- mid- and completion of either the MBSR or the attention control program as well as at 1- and 6-months post-program. Demographic information and information about health behaviors will be collected by self-report. Wrist actigraphy for an additional assessment of sleep quality will be done in an exploratory manner. Hierarchical linear modeling will be used to compute multilevel model for change based on full maximum likelihood estimation (Raudenbush S. W. and A. S. Bryk. 2002).

15,127,NCT03659903,Completed,Database We used the SEER database to analyze the data of patients with PDAC. The database includes patients of 18 registries in the USA from 1973-2013 encompassing approxi-mately 28% of the USA population. All the malignant cases were followed-up annu-ally to determine vital status. Patient Population All the variables' definitions are encoded in the SEER database. To identify the PDAC cases site codes (C25 pancreas C25.0-C25.9) and histology codes (8140 adenocarcinoma 8500 infiltrating duct carcinoma) based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology Third Edition (ICD-O-3) were used.11 Only cases that underwent PD and microscopically confirmed were included. Outcome Variables We only included those PDAC patients that underwent PD with precise data available for the following variables: age at diagnosis year of diagnosis gender race tumor site tumor size regional nodes positive regional nodes examined grade stage vital status and survival months. To clearly differentiate the difference of long-term survival between young and elderly patients all cases were divided into two group age < 80 years and age ≥ 80 years. Since 2004 the AJCC 6th stage has been used in the SEER database. Thus the diagnosis years of the cases included in our study ranged from 2004-2013. To analyze the median OS between different time periods we divided the year of diagnosis into two groups: 2004-2008 year and 2009-2013. Furthermore we also divided the tumor size into three groups: ≤ 2 cm 2-4 cm and > 4 cm. The lymph node ratio (LNR) is considered a robust prognostic factor after resection of pancreatic cancer and was es-timated using regional nodes positive divided by regional nodes examined.15 LNR was then categorized into three groups: 0% 1-50% > 50%.,Pancreas Cancer,pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma;pancreaticoduodenectomy,2018-09-01,,,Inclusion Criteria: - Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma，treatment by pancreaticoduodenectomy.Only cases that underwent PD and microscopically confirmed were included.

17,158,NCT03652298,Recruiting,"Procedure for patients and partners: Patients will be informed about the study by their treating oncologist at the end of the appointment when they will be informed about the metastatic incurable progression of their disease (announcement visit). Oncologists will provide the patients a written description of the study presenting the information previously orally provided by them together with the consent form to fill in. Signed informed consent will be sent back by post-mail if necessary (if participants ask for a time to think) using a pre-stamped envelope. Due to the objective to prevent distress recruitment to the study and random assignment of the intervention need to be performed within the 7 days following this announcement visit after making sure the patient is eligible for the study according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients and their spouse will be randomly assigned together (i.e. if the spouse participates he/she will be allocated to the same treatment arm as the patient) to receive the MSI + VB (experimental group) or to receive the supportive listening and attention (usual care serving as control condition) using an online centralized randomization program. Randomization will be implemented after the receipt of the consent form and balanced by (1) cancer type (bladder prostate kidney colorectal cancer sarcoma) (2) gender as these two variables are identified as risk factors of PTSD (for cancer type) and as impacting the MSI effects (for gender) in the literature and (3) the presence of the spouse during the announcement visit (yes/no) using a dynamic allocation program (minimization with a random factor set at 0.8). For reasons of feasibility no pre-screening aiming at including patients with a high risk of distress and potentially with high risk for developing PTSD will be realized. However during the first telephone session the psychologist will assess patients' level of stress using a 10-point likert scale similar to a past study before and after the MSI + VB intervention or the support and attention control session. This scale includes asking patients on a scale from 1 (no stress) to 10 (maximal stress) their level The treatment consists of a single telephone session conducted by a trained therapist maximum 10 days after receiving the announcement of the incurable disease progression. This is done in order to prevent PTSD as was already done when the MSI treatment was developed in traffic accident survivors (Gidron et al. 2001 2007). The same trained therapist will provide the MSI + VB intervention to the experimental group and give support and attention to the control group in order to control for therapist's effects. This telephone session will be followed by 3 follow-up telephone assessments (a week a month and 3 months after the previous telephone session) for collecting data by a research assistant who will not know in which group the participants are. All the sessions and interviews of the patient and his/her spouse (for treatments and for follow-up measures) will be conducted separately and the information will remain confidential between the patient and the spouse. Each of these telephone calls will be conducted from the participating center in order contact details of the participants remain inside the medical center to ensure the confidentiality of the data. Experimental intervention. In the experimental group participants will perform vagal breathing (VB) followed by the MSI followed again by VB. The VB component will guide participants how to perform deep slow vagal breathing by inhaling and counting 1-5 holding their breath and counting 1-2 and exhaling and counting 1-5 during 2-5 minutes. The MSI component will teach participants to chronologically organize the segments of their memory of the incurable diagnosis to verbally label feelings or somatic sensations they had at that moment and to provide causal links between the event's segments and causality to their feelings and sensations following the protocol of Gidron et al. (2001). In the MSI part the patient will talk and the therapist will note the different event parts and their real timing. Each time the patient says a feeling or sensation the therapist will ask to verbally elaborate and provide the cause of these feelings and sensations. Then the therapist will retell the story in a chronological manner with verbal titles and causes for feelings and sensations. Finally the patient will be asked to retell the story in this structured manner after being explained how to do so. patients in the MSI + VB group will be encouraged to perform it daily for 5-10min and especially before going to bed to reduce any sleeping arousal associated with PTSD symptoms Control. Participants in the control group will receive support and attention (usual care) and will be invited to recall announcement of the incurable disease progression. More precisely they will be invited to express their associated thoughts and feelings being free to talk about their experience and the psychologist will react with empathy and support. At Baseline for both arms i.e. at the beginning of the telephone interview where the trained therapist will call the participants the therapist will collect background information including age gender years of education self-reported length of couple relationship and psychotropic medication (anxiolytic antidepressant) in order to control the association between PTSD symptoms and anxiety and/or depressive disorder. 1. PTSD symptoms will be assessed by the post-traumatic checklist for DSM 5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al. 2013 French translation and validation by Ashbaugh et al. 2016). 2. Emotional regulation will be assessed by the BACQ scale (Finset et al. 2002). 3. Quality of life will be assessed by the EuroQol-5D scale (EQ-5D 3L) In both groups the trained therapist will also evaluate the degree of ""natural"" structuring regarding the way in which the patients/partners talk about the announcement visit. More precisely the trained therapist will rate both groups on their level of chronological organization of their story from 1 = totally disorganized; 2 = a bit organized; 3 = chronologically very organized (in the MSI + VB group: before and after the MSI training; in the control group: at the first time they recall their story) Afterwards three follows-ups will be conducted by telephone: 1 week 1 month and 3 months after the first intervention or control phone session.A research assistant blind to group assignments will collect the same self-reported measures initially collected by telephone at the first phone meeting. In sum levels of PTSD symptoms and quality of life will be assessed at each time (initial phone meeting 1 week 1 month and 3 months). However emotional regulation will be assessed at the first phone meeting and at one month only in order to reduce patients' burden. Patients and partners will also be asked if they have talked about the event to recall how and how often they have spoken about the event since the last phone call. For all the groups medical information including type and stage of cancer and type of cancer treatments will be collected at baseline by the medical staff (as summarized in the table below). Levels of albumin and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP reflecting inflammation) will also be obtained at baseline 1 month and 3 months when patients will come in any case to the hospital for their medical appointments (no medical appointment is anticipated at 1 week hence the absence of CRP and albumin measures at this time). Survival time will be monitored for all patients as well until the final analysis. We will calculate the quality-adjusted life years (QALY) for all patients to reflect both quantity and quality of survival. This will be done using the length of survival weighted by patients' score on the EQ-5D scale.",Colorectal Cancer;Bladder Cancer;Prostate Cancer;Kidney Cancer;Advanced Sarcoma,PTSD;Memory Structuring Intervention (MSI);Cancer;Vagal breathing,2021-07-25,,Prevention,Inclusion Criteria: - Men or women aged over 18 years old; - Who received in the last 7 days the diagnosis of metastatic incurable bladder prostate kidney colorectal or sarcoma cancer (including recurrence) during the announcement visit; - Whose life expectancy is estimated ≥ 6 months by their treating oncologist; - Who have a WHO performance score < 3 (to be coherent with the life expectancy); - Who have an albumin level > 30g/liter (patients with an acceptable state of nutrition); - Who are engaged in a couple relationship for at least 1 year; - Who gave their signed consent to participate in the study; - Who are covered by a social insurance.

Most of the literature recommend maintaining a pressure of 20-30 cmH2O to prevent cuff-related complications such as micro-aspiration or airway trauma. Proper pressure is also important for DLTs used in thoracic surgery. Furthermore the cuff pressure of the ETT can change during the patient's positional changes.

24,255,NCT03659968,Not yet recruiting,"Adapted physical activity (APA) in the context of cancer is a field of growing interest and has been explored in numerous publications. In adults the effects of APA on survival symptoms and quality of life are established and its physiological consequences on immunity angiogenesis and hormone secretion are under investigation. In children and adolescents evidence is scarce: pilot studies show clinical benefit of physical activity practiced in a wide variety of situations and protocols with low level of scientific evidence. It is therefore not possible to recommend this practice in pediatrics despite the large number of initiatives and the conviction of many clinicians that there is a benefit for patients. In particular there are few trials in children with advanced cancer pathologies or in palliative care. However these patients have a high prevalence of severe symptoms (pain digestive disorders asthenia and anxiety) for which physical activity may represent a therapeutic option. The purpose of our study is to describe a protocol of adapted physical activity and to evaluate its feasibility and toxicity according to a well-known and validated methodology in oncology used in drug development. Methodology is based on a simple and reproducible intervention combining brisk walking on treadmill and exercises of muscular strengthening with varying durations and intensities depending on physical capabilities of patients. The primary objective is to define the volume of physical activity that can be proposed to a patient starting APA based on the assessment of his physical condition evaluated by a 6-minutes walking distance test. Inclusion criteria are broad to allow study population to represent the diversity of patients in pediatric palliative oncology. Stratification of patients in three groups based on a 6-minutes walking distance test aims to adapt intervention to physical capability of patients and improve tolerance. Dose escalation will be set with a ""3 + 3"" regimen used in drug early phases trials. Primary outcome measure is perceived tolerance evaluated by the patient with a subjective scoring on CREST scale. Any score greater than 8/10 defines intolerance. Secondary objectives include the description of tolerance during sessions with shortness of breath and pain scores the comparison of objective (HR) and perceived measures and the study of patient's characteristics and medical history as confusion factors. The evolution of the patient's physical capability will be evaluated at the end of the study. The continuation of physical activity beyond the duration of participation will be documented.

26,260,NCT03653819,Recruiting,Lymphedema is a condition afflicting cancer patients who undergo surgery with removal of lymph nodes chemotherapy and radiation. Lymphedema is a consequence of impaired lymphatic drainage in the interstitium which causes edema and inflammation in the subcutaneous tissue. The symptoms are swelling puffiness tightness heaviness and pain in the affected area. Lymphedema can be reduced by complete decongestive therapy which consists of skin care manual lymphatic drainage compression bandaging and exercise. At the end of treatment patients are provided with custommade compression garments to be worn during daytime in order to maintain the reduction in the edema. Lymphedema has a negative impact on activities of daily living and health-related quality of life. Patients with lymphedema should be encouraged to engage in physical activity despite their condition in order to prevent relapse of cancer and development of other diseases. Likewise physical activity helps to maintain a healthy weight which is important as obesity has a negative impact on lymphedema. The lymphatic system is also stimulated by physical activity and exercise and can reduce the symptoms from the lymphedema. Several studies have been published on the safety and benefits of exercise for women with breastcancer related lymphedema.

30,325,NCT03658837,Not yet recruiting,Oesophago-gastric (OG) cancer is the fifth most common malignancy in the United Kingdom affecting approximately 16 000 people each year. Although surgery offers the best prospect for potential cure of OG cancers radical treatment may result in increased treatment relate mortality high treatment-induced morbidity and reduced quality of life. Traditionally many centres managing OG cancers focused on mortality and morbidity as their key outcome measures. However a growing body of opinion considers that a measure of broader effects of ill health and treatment on the patients quality of life (QOL) is necessary. Such considerations are important as it is questionable if patients are subjected to treatment merely to offer them a few extra months of life particularly if this is at the expense of quality of life. These includes physical functional social and physiological aspects of life. More than half of the operated patients will develop significant functional disorder after surgery affecting QOL. The most common problems observed are dysphagia dumping syndrome delayed gastric emptying and reflux.

32,329,NCT03657628,Not yet recruiting,Women who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing breast cancer but the processes through which exercise could make cancer less likely to occur are not known. Some research in animals has shown that exercise can slow the growth of breast cancer cells and may increase the body's own defense mechanisms by stimulating the immune system. Very little is known about the effects of exercise on breast tissue in people. Understanding what changes occur in breast tissue and related markers in blood when a woman begins to exercise could provide more information about the ways in which exercise could prevent breast cancer. The study is designed to look at the changes that occur in markers found in breast tissue and blood in women with dense breast tissue who take part in an exercise program. Density of breast tissue is a measure of how much of the breast tissue is made up of cells rather than fat. Breast density on mammogram has been linked to the risk of developing breast cancer with women with higher degrees of breast density having a higher risk of developing breast cancer compared to women whose breasts are less dense. Since the investigators do not know if these blood or breast tissue tests have any relationship to the development of breast cancer the investigators do not plan to share the results of these tests with the participant or its physician. The investigators will give the participants the option of receiving the overall study results when the trial is completed if the participant would like to receive them.,Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer,2024-08-31,,Prevention,Inclusion Criteria: - Written informed consent prior to any study-related procedures - Premenopausal women defined as: - having regular menstrual cycles - age ≤ 50 years with an intact IUD - history of hysterectomy without oophorectomy - Heterogeneously dense or very dense (BIRADS 3 or 4) breast tissue on mammogram within the last 3 years - Physically inactive; engaging in <90 minutes of moderate or vigorous intensity PA per week - No prior history of breast cancer - At least 18 years old - Physically able to exercise - English speaking and able to read English Exclusion Criteria: - Self-reported inability to walk 2 blocks (at any pace) - Prior history of breast cancer; prior DCIS is allowable as long as participant is not taking endocrine therapy and has at least 1 breast that has not been irradiated. - On oral contraceptives; Mirena IUD is acceptable - Cardiovascular respiratory or musculoskeletal disease or joint problems that preclude moderate physical activity.

33,340,NCT03658109,Not yet recruiting,Systemic administration of intravenous lidocaine has a number of observed and theoretical advantages in the perioperative period. Systematic review of perioperative lidocaine infusions has shown a reduction in early post-operative pain scores in patients undergoing abdominal surgery positive effects for GI recovery reduction in post-operative opioid requirements reduction in the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting and decreased length of hospital stay. They have been shown to modulate the surgery-induced stress response in colorectal surgery and abdominal hysterectomy. Thoracic epidural analgesia was better as compared to intravenous lidocaine in a RCT of patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery as part of an enhanced recovery program though there was similar impact on recovery of bowel function. Truncal regional anesthesia has been utilized in open and closed abdominal operations with various levels of efficacy. A statistically significant though marginal clinical analgesic benefit by recorded opioid consumption has been concluded by meta-analysis in patients undergoing abdominal laparotomy laparoscopy or cesarean delivery after US-guided TAP block. There was not found to be any additional benefit of TAP block in patients who received a spinal anesthetic that included a long-acting opioid. The interpretation of results was noted to be limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies and analysis though. The conclusions of one study of open prostatectomy as part of an ERP was that neither systemic lidocaine nor TAP block improved post-operative analgesia. Both IV lidocaine and TAP block groups showed a reduction in post-operative opioid consumption though to an insignificant degree. It was noted as a possibility that the other interventions as part of the ERP such as scheduled administration of IV acetaminophen could have resulted in the non-significant decrease in post-operative opioid requirement. A recent review of the use of TAP blocks in major gynecological non-obstetric surgery including total abdominal hysterectomy concluded that TAP blocks may contribute to early post-operative analgesia with marginal additional benefit if multimodal analgesic regimens including NSAIDs and acetaminophen are added. It was hypothesized by the authors that some of the limited benefit might be due to the fact that US-guided TAP blocks are primarily useful for somatic pain but that major gynecologic surgery has a large visceral pain component. There are limited randomized studies involving Quadratus Lumborum block (QL) at this time. QL block has shown improved analgesia in abdominal operations as compared to TAP block and is thought to have potentially greater relief of visceral pain. There is a case report of motor weakness following anterior lateral QL block for gynecologic laparoscopy thought to be related to spread of the block to affect the L2 dermatome on one side. It has not been determined if this is a common occurrence or may be affected by the type of QL block performed. Prior to this study truncal regional anesthesia was used in the UAB Gynecology-Oncology Surgery Enhanced Recovery Program as an analgesic alternative for those who were not good candidates for intrathecal opioid injection. A comparison of QL block versus systemic lidocaine infusion or whether either of these interventions has utility over intrathecal opioid administration alone has yet to be described.,Gynecologic Cancer,,2019-10-01,,Treatment,Inclusion Criteria: - Adult patients undergoing gynecologic-oncology surgery involving a mid-line laparotomy incision and as part of the local ERP who are initially identified as an outpatient - 18 years of age or older Exclusion Criteria: - Pregnancy - BMI>/=35 - Age >69 - Actual weight <65 kg - Severe COPD - Severe asthma - Other severe respiratory disease (ILD etc.) - Local anesthetic allergy - History of cardiac arrhythmia or heart block - CHF - Use of oral anti-arrhythmia agents or lidocaine analogues (i.e. mexiletine) - Inability to be a candidate for intrathecal opioid injection based on medical history and provider judgement,Female,True,18 Years,69 Years,,,
34,342,NCT03659071,Not yet recruiting,The childhood cancer experience necessarily impacts the entire family. In this context particular attention should be paid to the donor siblings of hematopoietic stem cells in the context of treatment of leukemia by grafting. The results of the little existing work on the long-term fate of stem cell donor siblings of cancer survivors report psychosocial consequences particularly for real post-traumatic stress in distant siblings. disease. Few studies have explored the medium and long-term impact of the disease as well as donation on a broader set of domains structuring the quality of life through validated quantitative tools. In France since 2004 the LEA program (Leukemia of the Child and Adolescent) aims to assess the determinants (medical socio-economic behavioral and environmental) of the state of health and quality of life in the medium and long term patients treated for acute childhood leukemia after 1980. To document the quality of life of their self-reported hematopoietic stem cell donor siblings and their perception of the impact that experience of cancer in the family has had on their medium and long-term future the organization of the LEA program can easily be extended to the establishment of an ancillary study. objectives The main objective of this study is to evaluate at a distance from the transplant the quality of life of donors from the siblings of survivors of acute childhood leukemia who received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant compared with non-donor siblings. The secondary objectives are: (a) to compare the quality of life of siblings with that of the general population; (b) to compare the quality of life of the siblings with that of the surviving patients; (c) to identify the determinants (demographic socioeconomic family and history of cancer) of the medium-long-term quality of life of this family; (d) remotely evaluate the donation's use of the donor sire care system as a tracer of the impact of the donation; (e) remotely evaluate the gift of the social integration of the donor sibship particularly in terms of schooling. The SIDONY ancillary study will be proposed to families of LEA patients who have received a geno-identical sibling haematopoietic stem cell transplant (population of interest) and to families whose LEA patient has not been treated by sibling transplantation. geno-identical but still declaring to have siblings (main comparator group). Each family will be contacted by mail and the management of inclusions will be managed by the Epidemiology and Health Economics Department of AP-HM (Marseille). Information not routinely available in the LEA database will be collected from the siblings (self-questionnaire to be returned by post): sociodemographic and socio-economic data relating to the siblings and the family; data concerning the quality of life of the siblings; psycho-behavioral and cognitive data; data on the state of health of the siblings; social inclusion data; recourse to the health care system. In addition for each surviving child included in the cohort data are available: sociodemographic; characteristics of the initial disease and therapeutic received; physical sequelae; quality of life. Feasibility and practical impact The population meeting the inclusion criteria represents 2639 subjects: 337 donors and 2302 non-donors making it possible to obtain high powers for analyzes (linear regression multilevel analyzes etc.). This study could identify profiles of siblings for whom the quality of life seems particularly impaired potential object of individual interventions (remediation ...).,Hematopoietic/Lymphoid Cancer,,2020-05-01,,Other,Inclusion Criteria: 1. experimental group familly: - child included in the LEA cohort - having received allogeneic treatment of geno-identical sibling haematopoietic stem cells 2.

40,389,NCT03655600,Not yet recruiting,Chronic pain following breast cancer surgery is a significant problem for women. There are over 3 million women in the United States living as breast cancer survivors. Sustained post-surgical pain is one of the most troubling side-effects for these women and continues to affect around 25-60% of breast cancer survivors with approximately half classifying pain as being moderate to severe. Chronic cancer-related pain is associated with increased fatigue depression anxiety sleep disruption and decreased quality of life and function. Acute pre- and post-operative pain are significant predictors of sustained pain following breast cancer surgery but are insufficiently managed. The etiology of persistent breast cancer related pain following surgery is multifactorial and may be the direct effect of cancer or cancer treatment (e.g. surgery). Known risk factors for this chronic pain include younger age higher body mass index type of surgery (axillary lymph node dissection) and presence of a mood disturbance. Cancer patients may develop pain from neurotoxicity from adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation may also play a role and causes persistent pain in 13 - 26% of patients. Two of the most significant factors that determine persistent pain following breast cancer surgery are the degree of pre-surgical pain and acute post-surgical pain. Recent reports have suggested that treatments aimed at reducing these factors may be effective at preventing the development of chronic pain following breast cancer surgery. Existing pre-emptive treatments to reduce this acute surgical pain include the use of nerve blocks and/or pharmacologic agents such as opioids NSAIDs ketamine and gabapentin. While some pharmacologic approaches yield clinically meaningful reductions in post-operative pain in the research setting there remains controversy in the field. For example in breast surgery specifically a recent meta-analysis showed that thoracic paravertebral blocks have a statistically significant effect on reducing chronic pain but the effect was not clinically meaningful and was associated with procedural risks such as vascular puncture. In addition to the risk of developing pain following breast cancer surgery women also report increased acute and chronic surgical pain following breast reconstruction surgery. In one of the first studies to examine pain post-reconstruction surgery Wallace et al. found that the incidence of pain one year following breast cancer mastectomy plus reconstruction was 49% as compared to 31% for mastectomy alone. This increase was both statistically and clinically significant and remains a current undertreated problem. Overall many women develop persistent pain after breast cancer surgery following either tumor removal or breast reconstruction. We know that this is influenced by acute pre- and post-surgical pain but unfortunately the existing measures available for clinicians to prevent persistent post-surgical pain are not adequate. Opioids are commonly used analgesics in the perioperative surgical setting; however they are accompanied by significant limitations. Opioids are the most common pharmacologic intervention used for acute perioperative surgical pain. They are known to decrease pain via activation of specific receptors (mu delta and kappa) which inhibit neuronal firing resulting in reduced nociceptive activity. Although widely prescribed there are significant limitations for opioid use including tolerance addiction diversion and even mortality. There were over 33 000 opioid deaths in the US in 2016 alone and the majority of these have been from opioid prescriptions. The US is currently experiencing an opioid epidemic wherein Americans constitute only 5% of the global population yet we consume over 80% of the world's opioid supply. Unfortunately while opioids are needed in the surgical setting the problem of increased opioid use is itself compounded by surgery. Patients receiving even low-risk surgeries are 44% more likely to become de novo long-term opioid consumers. With respect to breast cancer surgery the odds of developing chronic opioid consumption following mastectomy increases by approximately 300%. Although the reason(s) for developing chronic opioid consumption are largely unknown patients that receive a new opioid prescription within 7 days post-surgery as compared to those who do not are more likely to still be receiving opioids one year out. Thus acute pre-surgical and post-surgical pain in addition to being risk factors for persistent chronic pain may also increase the probability of becoming a chronic opioid consumer. There is an unmet need for analgesic interventions that are opioid sparing in the breast cancer surgical setting. This study proposes that acupressure may be one such option. Acupressure Self-administered acupressure is one possible safe self-management technique which may be effective for improving post-operative pain and opioid consumption. Acupressure a technique derived from acupuncture is a component of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in which pressure is applied to specific acupoints on the body using a finger or small device to treat disease. Prior research has demonstrated that acupressure self-administered by women with breast cancer significantly reduced clinically significant pain by approximately one-third and was superior to standard therapies. Moreover these self-rated improvements were maintained up to one month after treatment was discontinued. Acupressure has been found to be effective for acute post-surgical pain but no studies have examined the impact on the development of chronic pain or acute and chronic opioid use in any patient population. Four previous studies in diverse patient populations (appendectomy cesarean section gastric cancer and knee arthroscopy) have found that acupressure delivered by an acupressure practitioner was able to significantly decrease post-surgical pain compared to either usual care or sham acupressure from as early as 60 minutes after surgery to as long as 3 days post-surgery however no study has measured pain beyond 3 days post-surgery.29-32 As such it is unknown what impact if any acupressure has on the development of chronic pain post-surgery. Also no study has examined the impact of acupressure on either acute or chronic opioid use. In contrast the one study that used an acuband (a band worn around the wrist with a nub over the acupressure point to provide stimulation) at the P6 point commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting had no impact on post-surgical pain 24 hours after receiving an appendectomy. Along with a lack of research on acupressure's impact on chronic pain and opioid use the impact of this intervention on breast cancer patients undergoing surgery (mastectomy lumpectomy delayed or immediate reconstruction) is unknown. This study is a pilot randomized clinical trial to explore this intervention in 72 breast cancer patients scheduled for surgery.,Breast Cancer;Fatigue;Chronic Pain,,2020-08-01,,Other,Inclusion Criteria: 1.

45,419,NCT03654404,Not yet recruiting,Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a rigorous treatment for blood cancer patients that can be life-saving but often causes psychological distress. The investigators hope that this study will help the research team to develop and implement a positive psychological intervention designed to help HSCT patients increase positive emotions such as hope gratitude and fulfillment while recovering from a stem cell transplant. Participants will be selected after receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant treatment in the past 30 days at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). In this project the investigators hope to: 1. Test the feasibility and acceptability of a novel 8-week phone-based positive psychology intervention in a small cohort of post-HSCT patients (N = 15). 2. Explore potential benefits of completing the intervention on outcomes of interest such as positive affect and overall function. Baseline information about enrolled participants will be obtained from patients from the electronic medical record as required for characterization of our population. This information will include data regarding medical history current medical variables medications and sociodemographic data. Participants will be approached upon nearing their discharge from the hospital approximately 30 days after their transplant. Between the time of their discharge and their 100-day post-transplant visit there will be three check-in/psychosocial support phone calls at weeks 4 8 and 12 after discharge to build rapport and discuss their recovery. Then at week 14 participants will meet with the principal investigator to complete self-assessment questionnaires. The participants will then complete an 8-week phone-based positive psychology intervention at the end of which the self-assessment questionnaires will be repeated.,Hematologic Malignancy;Hematopoietic/Lymphoid Cancer;Blood Cancer,Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant;Positive Psychology;Hematologic malignancy;Positive Psychological Intervention,2019-09-15,,Supportive Care,Inclusion Criteria: - Adult patients with hematologic malignancies hospitalized for allogeneic HSCT at the DFCI inpatient units who are medically stable and appropriate for study approach - Ability to speak read and write English - Access to a telephone Exclusion Criteria: - Current major depressive episode bipolar disorder psychosis or active substance use disorder diagnosed via the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) - Cognitive deficits impeding a study participant's ability to provide informed consent or participate adequately in the study assessed via the Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS) - Medical conditions precluding interviews,All,,18 Years, ,facility:Dana Farber Cancer Institute|Boston|Massachusetts|02215|United States|status:Not yet recruiting|contact:Hermioni Lokko MD MPP|617-732-4241|Hermioni_lokkodfci.harvard.edu|investigator:Hermioni Lokko MD MPP|role:Principal Investigator,United States,

47,425,NCT03657108,Recruiting,Using preoperative MRI imaging to identify areas suspicious of local advancement in addition to identifying areas with a higher likelihood of a positive margin during RP due to the presence of high risk features Civasheet® and its inherently flexible structure allow the sheet to be directly implanted on areas suspicious for local advancement and positive surgical margins for direct application of radiation to these areas. The custom single planar layer integrative gold shielding of Civasheet® also allows radiation to be provided unidirectionally to allow healthy tissue (i.e. bladder rectum) to be shielded from radiation; possibly affording a lower rate of gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity and adverse events. During EBRT radiation especially for high risk PCa is provided at high rates to the entire prostatic bed with the seminal vesicles pelvic lymph nodes and a surrounding margin often targeted to eliminate positive margins and cancer from locally advanced areas in which the cancer may have spread (i.e. seminal vesicles bladder neck). These high rates of radiation often damage surrounding tissue and result in rectal and bladder complications in addition to urethral strictures among other adverse complications. Since Civasheet® will provide radiation to the prostatic bed a lower dose of EBRT will be used to treat the prostatic bed and potentially lower adverse bladder and rectal effects compared to RP + RT at 60 Gy. 103 Pd seeds of Civasheet® also illuminate on imaging. Therefore placing Civasheet® based on pre-operative identification of areas suspicious for local advancement and areas of likely positive surgical margins during RP will allow for targeted EBRT to the locally advanced areas. Since EBRT can be targeted using Civasheet® a lower and more direct dose of radiation during EBRT may be used to treat local advancement and positive surgical margins which will potentially reduce toxicity and complications associated with higher doses of radiation. The above properties are likely to facilitate improved cancer control with more direct and local application of radiation to areas of local advancement surrounding the prostate. These features are also likely to facilitate a reduced complication and toxicity profile since Civasheet® allows EBRT to be applied more accurately and at a lower dose and also the unidirectional radiation applied directly by Civasheet® protects surrounding healthy tissue from receiving radiation.No other studies have attempted to use Civasheet® to improve PCa control and reduce toxicity and complications associated with radiation for participants with high-risk prostate cancer. The investigators anticipate that implanting Civasheet® on areas suspicious for local advancement and positive margins based on pre-operative MRI findings and identification of high risk features in addition to relying on the illumination provided by Civasheet® for targeted adjuvant EBRT will provide a safer complication profile and eventually provide evidence for superior cancer control lower toxicity and less adverse events than EBRT+ RP alone in a future randomized controlled trial. The investigators therefore propose a phase I single-arm open label dose escalation study to evaluate the MTD and safety of Civasheet® with RP and adjuvant EBRT in a 3+3 dose escalation design among participants with high risk PCa.With this study the investigators to better understand the MTD safety and toxicity profile of Civasheet® in the setting of RP + adjuvant EBRT in the treatment of high-risk PCa.,Prostate Cancer,brachytherapy;prostatectomy;radiation therapy;surgery,2019-05-01,,Treatment,Inclusion Criteria: - Any subject with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) very high or high risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate defined as ≥T3a Gleason score ≥ 8 or PSA > 20 who is eligible for RP (open or robotic) with adjuvant EBRT as an initial treatment option. - Any subject with NCCN Intermediate Risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate defined as T2b-T2c Gleason score 7 or PSA 10-20 who is eligible for RP (open or robotic) with adjuvant EBRT as an initial treatment option and at least one of the following adverse features present in pre-operative imaging: seminal vesicle infiltration (SVI) extracapsular extension (ECE) N1 disease. - Subject must have had a pre-operative MRI or must obtain a pre-operative MRI to be eligible for participation in this study. - Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

51,463,NCT03651921,Recruiting,In 2016/17 the self-management program for cancer survivors the Cancer Thriving and Surviving Program (CTS) was translated into German. The content of the CTS was adapted to breast cancer specific needs in three interdisciplinary workshops based on a participatory approach including active patient engagement. Additional disease-specific topics were developed and confirmed applying a multi-stakeholder e-rating approach. After a consensus meeting with the participation of breast cancer survivors health care professional and international experts in the field of self-management consensus on the program was reached in June 2017 resulting in the CTS-BC-CH program i.e. a standardized manual for course leaders. This pilot study aims to explore the reach of the CTS-BC-CH program (integrated into the clinical pathway) and to investigate its preliminary effectiveness for female Swiss breast cancer patients. The CTS-BC-CH is delivered in two breast cancer centers in in the German-speaking part of Switzerland as a group-based program with seven weekly sessions of 2.5 - 3 hours led by trained peer-leaders. Course leaders have to complete a 4-days training provided by certified master trainers. First participants are enrolled for usual care followed by participants who will attend the CTS-BC-CH course.

52,477,NCT03650946,Recruiting,Prostate cancer is the 7th leading cause of cancer death for men in Taiwan. It is important to identify the extent of disease extent to deliver adequate treatment either for primary staging or in recurrence. However conventional imaging techniques including computed tomography bone scintigraphy and immunoscintigraphy with 111In-capromab pendetide are not sensitive or specific enough to detect metastatic or recurrent disease. Although more widely applied magnetic resonance still relies on size and shape criteria. 68Ga-PSMA is a new novel positron emission radiotracer which several preliminary data has shown to be effective of detecting recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer. These studies are confined to a small retrospective European population. In this study we aim to synthesize the novel tracer find the usefulness of 68Ga-PSMA PET in detecting prostate cancer including primary staging and recurrence explore the relationship between imaging and clinical parameters and seek the possibility of 68Ga-PSMA PET to predict tumor nature and prognosis.,Prostate Cancer,Prostate cancer;Ga-68 PSMA PET,2021-07-30,,,Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically confirmed prostate cancer Exclusion Criteria: - Patients with known malignancy in other organs. - Patients with severe claustrophobia or unstable vital sigh - Other serious comorbidities evaluated by primary investigator,Male,,40 Years,99 Years,facility:National Taiwan University Hospital|Taipei|100|Taiwan|status:Recruiting|contact:Ching Chu Lu|+886-2-23123456|phone_ext:65477|kelvinluntu.edu.tw,Taiwan,

64,586,NCT03658083,Recruiting,Lung cancer is the second most common cause of cancer in the UK and the most common cause of cancer death. Surgery is currently the most effective treatment for curing lung cancer and it can be performed using open (thoracotomy) or minimally invasive techniques (Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS)). Despite VATS being associated with fewer postoperative complications (PPCs) faster recovery and better survival at 4 years compared to thoracotomy it is only used by 20-44% of thoracic surgeons in the UK and just 5% of surgeons in Europe report using minimally invasive techniques for lung resection. Rigid restrictive instruments and suboptimal vision means a steep learning curve is necessary to conduct VATS successfully. RATS maybe a more attractive minimally invasive approach as it offers 3DHD vision a 360 degree view of the chest and a fully articulated arm. JCUH and the Barts Hospital are two of the few centers in the UK performing RATS. Research on RATS has been largely limited to single retrospective case series reports focusing on safety (PPCs and mortality) and cost effectiveness outcomes. Little research has been conducted exploring the effect of RATS on patient-centered outcomes that are also important quality measures. To date no studies have explored the impact of RATS on exercise capacity yet investigators know that individuals who undergo a thoracotomy have a 16% reduction in exercise capacity at 6 months follow up. Exercise capacity has been shown to be an important predictor for long-term prognosis and length of stay following thoracic surgery which can have substantial implications for cost. Furthermore percentage VO2 max has been shown to be the best predictor of PPCs within 30 days of undergoing a lung resection (predictive value 85.5%) which is an important indicator of patient safety. Two studies have looked at HRQOL post-RATS and compared it to an open technique. Balduyck and colleagues reported that whilst significant reductions from baseline were seen 1 month post-surgery in those who underwent an open procedure (sternotomy) HRQOL had returned to baseline values by 1 month post-surgery in those who underwent RATS. However indicators of whether individuals received RATS or an open procedure were not controlled for which is likely to be important as individuals who have large tumors are not eligible to receive RATS. Instead RATS is usually assigned to older frailer individuals. The second study did conduct between-groups comparisons between those who underwent a robotic lobectomy V those who received an open rib and nerve sparing lobectomy. The mental-component of the SF-12 was significantly higher in the robot group at 3 weeks post-surgery indicating better mental quality of life although there were no significant between-group differences detected for the physical-component. By 4 months follow up neither the mental nor the physical HRQOL scores differed between the two groups. The SF-12 in a general measure of health status and to date the impact of open surgery V RATS on disease-specific HRQOL has not been explored. Physical activity is associated with improved HRQOL in patients with lung cancer and increased survival post-diagnosis of cancer. However 2 months following a lung resection performed via a thoracotomy or VATS physical activity levels were still reduced. Unfortunately comparisons between surgical groups were not possible in this study due to the small number of patients who underwent VATS (14) therefore postoperative physical activity in those who have undergone thoracotomy compared to minimally invasive surgery is still unknown. Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) outcome indicator set 2015/16 includes enhancing quality of life and ensuring patients have a positive experience of care (NHS England 2015). To date no qualitative research exploring the patients' experience of RATS has been conducted and investigators have little understanding of patients' experience of thoracic surgery in general. Interestingly a very recent study exploring preoperative nurses work experience with robotics found that feelings of uncertainty and concerns about safety were common due to a lack of education about the robot system. It is likely these feelings of unease are translated to patients during their preoperative consultation leading to heightened anxiety. Furthermore if nurses do not feel they have sufficient information about the robot system they are unlikely to be educating patients fully about their procedure. A study exploring the appraisals of patients' experience of RATS is important to identify ways in which both pre and postoperative care can be improved. It would seem literature is scare exploring the impact of RATS on outcomes that are likely to be meaningful to patients. Therefore the overall aim of this study is to examine the impact of RATS compared to thoracotomy on patient-centered outcomes and to explore the individuals' experience of undergoing RATS. Research strategy Study design A mixed-method multi-center study will be undertaken utilizing a prospective quasi-experimental study design and an interpretive phenomenological approach. Inclusion/exclusion criteria Individuals referred for a lung resection with a primary or secondary diagnosis of lung cancer will be eligible although those with a tumor >7cm will be excluded. Individuals referred for a lung resection via thoracotomy will be recruited from James Cook University Hospital (JCUH) Middlesbrough and those referred for RATS will be recruited from JCUH or St Bartholomew's hospital London (Barts). Recruitment Once a referral for a lung resection via thoracotomy or RATS is received a cover letter and information sheet containing details of the study will be mailed to patients along with their clinic appointment letter. Interested patients will be encouraged to contact a member of the research team by telephone or email to discuss the study in more detail. When patients attend their preoperative clinic a member of the clinical team will request permission for a member of the research team to approach them about participation in the study. If individuals would like to participate in the study informed consent will be obtained. Surgical care Prior to surgery all patients receive standard physiotherapy consisting of breathing exercises and advice on activities postoperatively. Three cardiothoracic surgeons 2 at JCUH and 1 at Barts will perform lung resections. Consistent with usual care at JCUH and Barts all individuals will be transferred to sitting at the bedside as soon as possible post-surgery and will be required to walk 150m before being discharged home. At JCUH patients are also required to complete a flight of stairs and cycle for five minutes (with no resistance). Data collection Demographic and anthropometric information will be collected at baseline at the preoperative clinic visit including; age sex BMI lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC)) smoking history comorbidities cancer stage and grade. Details of the operation (i.e. technique time surgeon post-operative pain management) will be documented. Length of stay readmissions and PPCs will be recorded at 3 months follow-up. The same criteria will be used to define a PPC as applied by Brocki et al. PPCs will be classified as minor (a score of 1) medium (a score of two) or severe (a score of three). A PPC will be defined as clinically relevant if two or more items are graded as a minor complication (score of 1) or one item is graded as a medium or severe complication (scores ≥2). Quantitative phase Outcomes will be assessed at 4 time-points; at baseline in the preoperative clinic (1 day to 2 weeks prior to surgery) day 3 post-surgery at the follow up postoperative clinic visit (within 6 weeks post-surgery) and at an additional hospital visit which will take place at 3 months. The time taken to complete each assessment will be recorded we estimate no more than 2 hours will be required to complete the outcome variables (ISWT the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C30) and the EORTC Lung Cancer module (EORTC QLQ LC13)). Individuals will also be requested to wear an activity monitor Actigraph G3TX (Actigraph) immediately post-surgery until 1-week post-discharge. Data will be stored on the cardiothoracic database at JCUH or Barts and on an IBM SPSS statistics database at Teesside University. Qualitative phase An interpretive phenomenological approach (IPA) will be applied to the collection and analysis of the qualitative data. IPA aims to understand the lived experience of participants in response to a specific event (i.e. undergoing surgery). Analysis examines in detail how an event is experienced and what meaning is ascribed to that event. An informal interview schedule consisting of open-ended questions will be developed in conjunction with members of the cardiothoracic team. The questions will be developed to stimulate narratives focusing on the experience of undergoing RATS whilst also permitting other topics important to the individuals to be discussed. In-depth interviews will be conducted on up to 15 patients who underwent RATS. The interviews will be conducted at patient's homes one week following hospital discharge (at the same time the activity monitor is collected). Interviews will be largely patient led allowing individuals to tell their own story in their own words and at their own pace. Sample Size and Analysis Plan Quantitative phase The primary endpoint is exercise capacity measured by the ISWT (m) completed at patients' 6-week postoperative clinic. Based on the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) (48m) for the ISWT (Singh et al 2008) the between-subjects variability in the measure and the variability in the change scores (the 7-week reliability). A conventional estimation with 90% power and 2 p=0.05 returned a required sample size of 80 patients 40 per group. This is based on an ANCOVA analysis model where invetigators look at the differences in the change in ISWT between groups adjusted for any imbalance between groups in ISWT performance at baseline Qualitative phase Analysis will involve conducting a close line-by-line analysis on each original transcript to explore the claims and understandings of the participants. A second researcher will review the original transcripts before the 'emerging themes' are agreed. Once agreed 2 researchers will transfer the 'emerging themes' across the entire data set thereafter referring to them as 'master themes' The final master themes will be presented to a third researcher and agreed. Thematic mapping will be used to develop the relationship between themes. Finally the findings will be translated into a narrative account with verbatim extracts (quotes) to provide a means of validation.,Lung Cancer;Thoracic Cancer;Surgery,exercise;physical activity;quality of life;qualitative;recovery,2019-12-31,,,Inclusion Criteria: - Individuals referred for a lung resection via thoracotomy or RATS with a primary or secondary diagnosis of lung cancer Exclusion Criteria: - Tumor >7cm,All,, , ,facility:Barts Health NHS Trust|London|United Kingdom|status:Not yet recruiting|contact:Steven Stamenkovic|020 7370 700|Steven.Stamenkovicbartshealth.nhs.uk;facility:James Cook University Hospital|Middlesbrough|United Kingdom|status:Recruiting|contact:Joel Dunning|01642 854612|joeldunningnhs.net,United Kingdom,
65,588,NCT03651271,Not yet recruiting,"The aim of this study is to provide a prospective classification of CD8 high (immunologically ""hot"") versus CD8 low (immunologically ""cold"") tumors at the time of treatment based on the percentage of CD8 cells in a tumor biopsy and to address the predictive value of the CD8 biomarker for selecting patients for treatment with nivolumab with or without ipilimumab. A total of up to approximately 200 participants will be enrolled. However to account for unexpected challenges in obtaining information on the percentage of tumoral CD8 cells enrollment to initial biopsy may be about 10% higher (ie ~220 participants). Ongoing monitoring for safety and futility will be implemented based on the method of Thall and colleagues (Thall et al 1995) separately in the CD8 high and CD8 low tumor groups. Single-agent nivolumab will be administered at 360 mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W). Participants who continue to show clinical benefit after the first disease assessment will receive nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks (Q4W) until progressive disease (PD) or intolerable toxicity. At PD participants will be allowed to add ipilimumab. For nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy nivolumab will be administered at 360 mg IV Q3W and ipilimumab will be administered at 1 mg/kg IV Q3W for the first 2 doses and then every 6 weeks for the 3rd and 4th doses followed by nivolumab 480 mg IV Q4W until PD or intolerable toxicity. After receipt of the first dose of ipilimumab the Investigator may determine (based on clinical symptoms) the number of future doses of ipilimumab the participant will receive for a maximum of 4 doses. Participants who stop ipilimumab dosing early due to toxicities may start nivolumab maintenance (ie 4 doses [12 weeks] of nivolumab following the first dose).",Advanced Metastatic Cancer,,2022-09-14,,Treatment,"Inclusion Criteria: 1.

66,594,NCT03650803,Not yet recruiting,The objectives of this study are to assess the utility of quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in assessment of response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Magnetic Resonance (MR) Fingerprinting based relaxometry allows quantification of T1 and T2 relaxation times of tumor and normal breast tissue. Response to chemotherapy is associated with measurable changes in these properties and may be used to predict treatment response earlier than conventional MRI. The study team hypothesize that 3D MRF before during and after chemotherapy can provide additional quantitative information about changes during treatment and may predict early response to chemotherapy. During visit 1 3D MR Fingerprinting images will be added to the clinical MRI scan before start of chemotherapy. The additional research images will take less than 20 minutes to acquire During visit 2 patients will be scheduled for a research only non-contrast 3D MR Fingerprinting scan 7-10 days after the first cycle of chemotherapy. Acquisition of images will take approximately 30 minutes. During visit 3 if the treating physician orders a clinical MRI scan within 1 month of the end of chemotherapy treatment the investigators will add a 3D MR Fingerprinting sequence to the clinical scan. The additional research images will take less than 20 minutes to acquire. If the patient is not scheduled for a clinical scan within 1 month of the end of chemotherapy treatment the investigators will contact the patient to schedule a research only 3D MR Fingerprinting scan. The study team would like to administer IV gadolinium contrast for research purposes. Patients will be reconsented prior to the research only scan to determine whether or not they will receive IV contrast. If the patient declines administration of contrast for the post treatment scan the study team will perform a non-contrast scan.

70,657,NCT03651037,Not yet recruiting,Significance: Cancer treatment-induced bone loss and the subsequent risk of fractures in both men and women is a significant burden on national health care. The number of cancer survivors in the United States will reach 18 million by 2022 and by 2025 the projected burden of osteoporosis is $25.3 billion. Cancer patients treated with medications that lower hormone levels face an increased risk of fractures. Clinical studies report that moderate- intensity resistance exercises prevent a decline in bone health in female cancer survivors and that strength training may reduce complications associated with cancer such as fatigue muscle wasting and bone loss. Unfortunately only a small percentage of female cancer survivors engage in and adhere to a strength training exercise routine. Several factors account for this low level of engagement such as poor awareness of the benefits of exercise lack of motivation and the lack of affordable and easily accessible exercise programs designed for cancer survivors. Internet-based self-managed programs of exercises and guidance can potentially address these problems and can be scaled for broader dissemination. Innovation: The Thrivors internet-based platform seeks to shift the current paradigm of poor adherence to exercise by providing an affordable and accessible means of improving outcomes for cancer survivors. The proposed product Thrivors+BH will be a first-of-its-kind offering of clinically validated bone health exercises that can be customized to a cancer survivor's pain and energy levels with several novel interactive feedback features. The product will also have supportive modules for connecting with a community of other users mindfulness training nutritional advice and a repository of educational information. The Thrivors platform is scalable device-agnostic and allows analysis of de-identified usage data. With commercialization potential for healthcare providers and health insurance payers Thrivors provides a value-based care delivery model focused on outcomes. There are multiple important physiologic and psychosocial secondary conditions that could be positively impacted by the Thrivors platform. For this specific application the investigators will focus on adherence to bone health exercises. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesized that breast cancer survivors' adherence to an exercise regimen for bone health can be improved by enhancing the interactive and customizable features of a cloud-based device-agnostic delivery method. To test the hypothesis and to establish the technical feasibility of the product the investigators propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop an enhanced participant experience platform for bone health-specific exercises. For Thrivors+BH a module will be developed for participants to input pain and energy levels enabling real-time customization of exercise regimens. Modules of clinically validated bone health exercises with instructional videos will be developed. Additionally participants will be able upload and send videos of themselves exercising for feedback and assessment. A Thrivors Basic version that lacks customization and video content will be developed. Both versions will contain bone health educational content mindfulness and nutrition resources. Milestones: Over a 2-month period development usability testing (assessing content features input controls navigational ease and click-through capabilities) and refinement will be completed to enable deployment in a randomized clinical trial. Specific Aim 2: Measure participant adherence and engagement. The two versions of the platform will be deployed in a 20-week two-arm randomized controlled trial of 50 breast cancer survivors. Adherence to exercise sessions (primary outcome) and platform usage will be measured by platform software while user engagement (secondary outcomes) will be assessed by surveys. Milestones: Differences between primary and secondary outcomes for the control and intervention groups will be evaluated. Usage statistics motivational responses and user feedback will be used to further refine platform features and content. The outcomes of this study will help validate the utility of the Thrivors platform in improving cancer survivors' adherence and engagement to exercise routines that positively impact post-treatment recovery. In the near-term the findings will inform the design of a 12-month Phase II study to evaluate changes in biomarkers of bone health. In the longer term the project aligns with the business goal to disseminate the Thrivors platform to a larger population of male and female cancer survivors across ethnic/racial minority groups rural populations and low socioeconomic status groups. The project also aligns with the mission of the NCI to develop innovative technology and service delivery models that increase the adoption uptake and sustainability of evidence-based interventions to improve public health.,Breast Cancer;Physical Activity;Bone Health,cancer;bone health;physical activity;technology platfrom,2019-08-19,,Supportive Care,Inclusion Criteria: - Female participants diagnosed at 40 - 70 years with non-metastatic breast cancer. - Able to provide written informed consent. - Completed chemotherapy undergoing adjuvant hormonal therapy. - Not currently on a prescribed exercise plan and cleared for exercise by physician. - Access to a smart phone (with a data plan) tablet or computer (with internet access). - Able and willing to comply with the protocol including completion of all surveys.

74,734,NCT03652428,Not yet recruiting,The investigators propose a phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and the recommended dose for phase II (RP2D) of concurrent nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine in combination with ablative IMPT delivered as a fixed dose of 67.5 Gy in 15 fractions daily fractions with 5 fractions per week. In contrast to prior pancreatic cancer studies of chemoradiotherapy which utilized photon RT to treat gross disease and elective lymph nodes (1 2) the proposed study is hypothesized to reduce toxicity risk by limiting highly conformal IMPT to the gross tumor volume. Furthermore to increase the margin of safety in a manner similar to published data from MDACC (3) the high dose region will be limited to areas at least 5 mm from nearby GI structures (duodenum small bowel stomach etc.). Regions within this area will be treated only to 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions. This dose limitation is also important given that paclitaxel in addition to increasing systemic efficacy is a known radiosensitizer (1).,Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer,LAPC;Nab-paclitaxel +Gemcitabine;Proton Therapy,2022-12-01,,Treatment,Inclusion Criteria: 1.

75,758,NCT03653988,Not yet recruiting,The current standard of care at the University of Iowa is to receive a pectoralis nerve block (PEC I/II) prior to surgery for mastectomy and reconstruction cases. The investigators will compare whether patients will have better pain control if they were to receive (PEC I/II block) before surgery or after the mastectomy. Patients undergoing mastectomies at the University of Iowa Hospitals clinics receive general anesthesia and a regional block for pain control. The most commonly employed regional anesthetic technique is a PECS I/II block to anesthetize the pectoral intercostobrachial third to sixth intercostal and long thoracic nerves. The PECS I/II blocks are pectoralis field blocks where local anesthetic medication is injected under ultrasound guidance between the tissue planes of pectoralis major and minor muscles (PECS I) and in the plane of the serratus anterior muscle at the level of the third rib (PECS II). The investigators will randomize patients into two groups and blind the patient and the research assistant collecting the data. Group I will have the block performed after induction of general anesthesia and prior to surgical incision by the anesthesiologist. Group II will have the block administered by the surgeon after mastectomy is performed and before reconstruction. On the day of surgery the investigators will have patients fill out forms to measure pain catastrophizing and depression and anxiety. The investigators would like to measure if there is any difference in postoperative pain scores (visual analogue scale)-immediately post surgery in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and then on the admission unit every 4 hours for the first twenty four hours or on discharge (whichever time-point occurs sooner) and will collect the average pain scale of the day on post-op day (POD) 2 3 5 and 7 via patient communication electronic message in RedCap. The investigators will also measure intraoperative and post-operative narcotic use (converted to morphine equivalents) post-operative nausea and vomiting length of (PACU) stay. In addition the investigators will also collect pain scores and pain catastrophic scale on POD 14 after surgery at their clinic visits to the surgeon. Other data collected will include time taken to perform block post-operative infection rate and post-operative flap necrosis rate.,Breast Cancer;Postoperative Pain;Anesthesia;Nerve Block,Nerve block;Pectoralis nerve blocks;PECS I;PECS II;Mastectomy,2019-11-01,,Health Services Research,Inclusion Criteria: - At least 18 years of age - Female - Bilateral mastectomy for breast cancer - Undergoing breast reconstruction - Must weigh at least 50 kg Exclusion Criteria: - More than 80 years of age - Male - Prisoners - Patients who can't provide their own consent - Lumpectomy only patients - Patients having prophylactic mastectomies - Patient must weigh at least 50 kg - Allergies to local anesthetics - Patient refusal - Patients with a history of bleeding disorders - Non-English speaking patients,Female,True,18 Years,80 Years,,,
76,759,NCT03654105,Not yet recruiting,The most recent population-based studies carried out in Europe and the US on hundreds of thousands of individuals have unequivocally identified three principal causes of mortality morbidity and chronic disability: tobacco smoke inadequate diet and reduced physical activity. These risk factors are in large part reversible because in heavy smokers even after 60 years of age cessation is associated with a clear reduction in all-cause mortality. The finding that lifestyle and eating habits are associated with the development of cancer has been confirmed in many studies: smoking a sedentary lifestyle excess red meat processed foods and sugars are associated with increased risk while an active lifestyle non-exposure to smoke (both active and passive) consumption of whole grains legumes and vegetables are associated with protection or a reduced incidence in at-risk subjects. What is clear and confirmed by many studies is that cancer occurs more often in overweight individuals and that cancer patients who are overweight have more difficulty treating their disease. Elevated plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) even when still within normal limits are the reflection of a chronic state of inflammation and are associated with poor prognosis in several tobacco-related diseases. CRP measurement is besides a simple test to predict the risk of heart attack and stroke as well as mortality from all causes and from cardiovascular disease. In a systematic review on adult solid tumors elevated CRP levels were associated with higher mortality and recurrence rates and this observation was confirmed in early-stage lung cancer by a recent meta-analysis. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) high CRP is a strong and independent predictor of future morbidity and mortality and an increase in CRP concurrent with a reduction of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) shows an even stronger effect on patient's outcome. High levels of CRP are associated with poor prognosis in cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract rhinopharynx lung and urinary tract. From a dietary point of view consumption of saturated fats has been directly associated with an increase in inflammatory status as measured by high levels of CRP just like consumption of meat while an inverse correlation with consumption of vegetables has been observed. For example low levels of inflammatory factors have been found in individuals adhering to a Mediterranean diet. Another recurrent finding at least for cancer is the importance of daily physical activity such as brisk walking for 30 minutes. Moreover regular physical activity is associated with better prognosis and increased survival in patients with a cancer diagnosis. The number of heavy smokers that will participate in early-diagnosis programs using spiral CT will undoubtedly increase in the future as a result of awareness campaigns and the participating volunteers represent an excellent opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of targeted primary prevention programs. The present program will combine several interventions according to the randomization arm proposed in combination or in single treatment including treatment with cytisine reduction of chronic inflammation by treatment with low-dose aspirin (ASA) targeted modification of diet and physical activity in addition to early diagnosis with annual ultra low-dose spiral computed tomography (LDCT). At baseline each volunteer will undergo: - questionnaires on population evaluation (e.g. socio-demographic smoking habits physical activity etc) - blood sampling for the assessment of the inflammatory and metabolic profile - evaluation of respiratory function and measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) - thorax ultra low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) without contrast - anthropometric evaluation (e.g. weight height BMI etc) To reduce levels of chronic inflammation will be used: - treatment with low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) - dietary / nutritional intervention in order to promote an optimal diet based on characteristic of the Mediterranean Diet for weight maintenance visceral fat control and an adequate nutritional status - physical activity intervention through the reduction of sedentary behaviour and the implementation of a moderate intensity activity of about 30 min a day In the Smoking cessation will be used Cytisine. It is a molecule known since the early 60s for the treatment of smoking. In recent clinical trials it revealed efficacy in smoking cessation. In 2014 the NHS (National Health Service) produced a document evaluating the cost-effectiveness of drug treatment of smoking concluding that cytisine has the most favorable profile among the drugs taken into consideration The imaging will be performed by volumetric acquisition with a computed tomography scanner equipped with advanced technology hardware and software including: high performance X-ray tube with low potential high sensitivity detectors combined with dedicated reconstruction algorithms for optimisation of the signal to noise ratio within an ultra low radiation dose. The protocol for ultra-low dose computed tomography will be specifically set for lung cancer screening with semiautomated image analysis and nodule quantification according to the international standard for image quality (Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Alliance). In particular the ultra-low dose computed tomography protocol will be developed for the lowest radiation exposure and tested by dedicated phantom for quantitative analysis of imaging metrics. In the control group subjects will receive an information booklet containing advice on an optimal lifestyle with particular reference to smoking diet and physical activity according to the best international guidelines.,Inflammation;Smoking Cessation;Diet Modification;Physical Activity;Lung Cancer,Inflammation;Primary Prevention;Multiple Prevention;Lung Cancer Screening;Smoking Cessation;Diet;Physical Activity;CRP,2020-10-01,,Prevention,Inclusion Criteria: - Age between 55 and 75 years - High consumption of cigarettes (≥ 30 packs/year) - Elegibility to annual LDCT screening - Confidence in Internet use - Absence of tumors for at least 5 years - Signed informed consent form Exclusion Criteria: - Hypersensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid salicylates or any of the excipients (excipients: cellulose powder corn starch coating: copolymers of methacrylic acid sodium lauryl sulfate polysorbate 80 talc triethyl citrate) - Chronic treatment with acetylsalicylic acid or other anti-clotting or anti-coagulant drugs (for example: heparin dicumarol) - Treatment with methotrexate - Existing Mastocytosis - History of asthma induced by the administration of salicylates or substances to similar activity particularly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs - Gastroduodenal ulcer - Hemorrhagic diathesis - Severe chronic pathology (eg: severe respiratory and / or renal and / or hepatic and / or cardiac insufficiency) - Serious psychiatric problems - Previous treatment with Cytisine - Abuse of alcohol or other substances (even previous),All,,55 Years,75 Years,facility:Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori|Milan|20133|Italy,Italy,

97,911,NCT00052611,Completed,Celecoxib is being studied in precancerous lesions of the head and neck in part because it has been shown to prevent the progression of another type of precancerous polyps (a type of abnormal growth) in patients at high risk for colorectal cancer. There are however no published studies yet looking at this drug in humans for the prevention of head and neck cancers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved celecoxib for arthritis and the prevention of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (a type of precancerous syndrome in some families that can lead to colon cancer). This study is being done to find out several things: - Is celecoxib also known by the trade name Celebrex ® effective in reducing the expression of precancerous markers (biological signals for specific cellular activities) in oral leukoplakia and dysplasia (abnormal growth) of the oral mucosa? - Is celecoxib effective in reducing the size of oral leukoplalda lesions and/or presence of dysplasia? - Does the reduction in precancerous markers correspond with reduction of oral leukoplalda and/or presence of dysplasia? - What are the side effects of celecoxib in this patient population?,Head and Neck Cancer,lip and oral cavity cancer;paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer;hypopharyngeal cancer;laryngeal cancer;oropharyngeal cancer;nasopharyngeal cancer;salivary gland cancer,2005-03-01,,Treatment,Inclusion Criteria: - Subjects will be ≥ 18 years. - Subjects will have oral leukoplakia on clinical examination and/or more than one previous HNSCC with dysplasia histologically proven on random biopsy within 6 months at the time of entry. - Patients who have had surgical treatment for a previous HNSCC stage I-III will be eligible for enrollment if they are cancer-free ≥ 9 months at the time of entry.

One group (2/3rds of all the patients) will be taking tipifarnib in combination with another anticancer drug called letrozole and the other group (1/3rd of all the patients) will be taking letrozole plus a placebo (an inactive substance given in the same form as a real drug). The assignment to one of these two groups will be by chance (like flipping a coin). Unless the need arises neither the patient nor the study staff will know whether the patient is receiving tipifarnib with the letrozole. Comparisons between the two groups will be made for patients who have achieve a confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). The interval between the date of randomization and the earliest date of disease progression will also be assessed. The study will include evaluations of safety and tolerability. Patients should expect their participation in this trial to last a minimum of 4 to 8 weeks. Their participation could continue for several months or beyond a year depending on how their disease responds to the treatment. After completing study treatment patients will be asked to attend for an End of Treatment visit and then a posttreatment Follow-up visit 4 to 6 weeks after stopping the medication. Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment with either 2.5 mg letrozole once daily plus placebo to match tipifarnib twice daily or 2.5 mg letrozole once daily plus 300 mg tipifarnib twice daily. Both tipifranib and matching placebo will be given in 28-day cycles of 21 days of treatment followed by 7 days rest. All patients will receive continuous treatment with letrozole.,Breast Cancer,Breast cancer;ZARNESTRA;tipifarnib;R115777;Estrogen receptor positive;Progesterone receptor positive;Anti-estrogen therapy,2008-01-01,,Treatment,Inclusion Criteria: - Locally advanced inoperable loco-regionally-recurrent or metastatic breast cancer - Estrogen and/or progesterone positive disease - Progression of disease after antiestrogen therapy - Measurable disease - Postmenopausal - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 1 or 2.

107,956,NCT00055380,Completed,A significant problem in drug development of novel small molecules is the lack of available tissues (surrogate tissues) that allow for the assessment of the molecular and biochemical effects of (targeted-therapies) drug action. The information obtained from surrogate tissues might help us validate previous preclinical studies with those agents and also dose them in a more rational way. Oral keratinocytes which are accessible by non-invasive means might be useful to assess drug action. The proposed study seeks to investigate the genetic molecular and biochemical effects of novel agents in oral buccal mucosal cells. Patients already enrolled in Phase I and II clinical trials for neoplastic diseases at the Clinical Center will undergo oral cytobrushing before and during therapy to determine the molecular and biochemical effects of novel agents in the oral mucosa cells. Similar studies will be performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In order to validate to compare and compare the oral cytobrush methodology some of these subjects will undergo oral punch biopsy studies. Some of these subjects will also undergo tumor biopsy if accessible or available.,Cancer,Molecular Targets;Keratinocytes;Cell Cycle;Small Molecule;Gene Expression;Pharmacodynamics;Surrogate Markers;Targeted Therapy;Buccal Mucosa;Pharmacogenomics;Oral Mucosa,2005-10-01,,Treatment,INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients (male female greater than or equal to age 18 years) enrolled in a clinical trial at the Clinical Center receiving novel small molecules that modulate cell cycle progression for the prevention and treatment of neoplastic diseases. Able to sign informed consent. Patient's primary NIH physician should agree with appropriateness of patient's participation in the study. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients unable to undergo cytobrushing (significant mucositis). Non-compliant patients. Patients unable to provide baseline samples (patients already receiving therapy). Exclusion for biopsy only: patients with significant bleeding diathesis receiving active anticoagulation or with platelets less than 10K.

108,962,NCT00052910,Completed,OBJECTIVES: - Compare overall survival in patients with resected gastric adenocarcinoma treated with epirubicin cisplatin and infusional fluorouracil (5-FU) vs 5-FU bolus and leucovorin calcium before and after 5-FU plus radiotherapy. - Compare disease-free survival and local and distant recurrence rates in these patients treated with these regimens. - Correlate the expression of putative prognostic markers (including TS ERCC-1 MSI E-cadherin EGFR p27 COX-2 and c-erbB-2) with overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Correlate specific germline polymorphisms related to chemotherapy metabolism and resistance (including UGT2B7 [epirubicin] GST [cisplatin] ERCCI [cisplatin] XRCC1 [cisplatin] TS [5-FU] DPD [5-FU] and EGFR polymorphisms) with treatment-related toxicity and overall survival of these patients. - Correlate serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) IGF-2 and IGF-binding protein 3 with overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to depth of tumor penetration (T1 or T2 vs T3 vs T4) lymph node involvement (0 vs 1-3) and extent of lymphadenectomy (D1 or D2 vs D0 or unknown). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV and fluorouracil (5-FU) IV on days 1-5 of courses 1 3 and 4. Courses repeat every 28 days. During course 2 patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week and receive 5-FU IV continuously for 5 weeks. Patients rest for 28-35 days between course 2 and 3. - Arm II: Patients receive epirubicin IV over 3-15 minutes and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and 5-FU IV continuously on days 1-21 during course 1. Beginning 1 week later patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week and receive 5-FU IV continuously for 5 weeks. Patients rest for 28-35 days before beginning course 2 of chemotherapy. Patients then receive epirubicin cisplatin and 5-FU as in course 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years every 4 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 824 patients will be accrued for this study.,Esophageal Cancer;Gastric Cancer,stage I gastric cancer;stage II gastric cancer;stage III gastric cancer;adenocarcinoma of the stomach;adenocarcinoma of the esophagus;stage I esophageal cancer;stage II esophageal cancer;stage III esophageal cancer,2016-12-01,,Treatment,1. Required Tumor Parameters 1.1 Patients must have histologically diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction. Adenocarcinomas of the esophagus that are not involving the gastroesophageal junction are not eligible. 1.2 Patients must have had en bloc resection of all known tumor. The surgical resection must have been done with a curative intent. 1.3 Patients must have tumor extension beyond muscularis propria and/or nodal involvement without evidence of M1 disease. - Patients can have stages IB if there is evidence of either node-positive (N1) disease or tumor extension beyond the muscularis propria (i.e. T1 N1 M0 patients are eligible but patients with T2 N0 M0 are allowed only if there is extension beyond the muscularis propria). - Patients can have stages II IIIA IIIB or stage IV with M0 (i.e. T4N2M0). - Stages 0 IA or any stage with M1 are not allowed. (see Appendix I for TNM staging guide). 1.4 Patients with known unresected cancer recurrent cancer microscopic evidence of tumor at the distal or proximal line of stomach resection noncontiguous resection of tumor or M1 (metastatic) disease are ineligible. 2. Prior Therapy 2.1 No prior therapy (except hormonal or biologic) for other malignancies is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer noninvasive carcinoma in situ which has been fully resected or other cancer for which the patient has been disease free for five years. 2.2 Patients who have had any previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy are ineligible. 3. Patient Characteristics 3.1 Patients must have an ECOG (CTC) performance status of 0 1 or 2. 3.2 Patients are required to have an adequate total caloric intake to allow them to maintain their post-surgical body weight. Patients must have documentation of stable weight (or less than 2 pounds weight loss) for at least one week prior to registration. 3.3 All patients must be evaluated by a radiation oncologist (prior to enrollment) to ensure that the patient is an appropriate candidate for radiation therapy. 3.4 Patients may not have unilateral renal function (only one functioning kidney) as determined by CT scan with contrast urogram renal scan or other study. 3.5 Pregnant or lactating women may not participate. Men and women of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method or practice abstinence while in this study. - The effects of therapeutic radiotherapy are known to be teratogenic. - The effects of Epirubicin Cisplatin and 5-FU on a developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are less well known. - For this reason and because DNA alkylating agents are known to be teratogenic women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. - Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating on this study she should inform her treating physician immediately. Because the risk of toxicity in nursing infants secondary to Epirubicin Cisplatin and 5-FU treatment of the mother is unknown but may be harmful breastfeeding should be discontinued. 3.6 Patients with any of the following cardiac conditions are ineligible: - Uncontrolled high blood pressure - Unstable angina - Symptomatic congestive heart failure - Myocardial infarction < 6 months prior to registration - Serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia - New York Heart Association classification III or IV. 3.7 No uncontrolled serious medical or psychiatric illness which would prevent compliance with treatment or adequate informed consent. 3.8 Patients with active infectious process are ineligible. 3.9 Patients with grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy at baseline are ineligible. 4.

117,997,NCT00059605,Completed,"DOTAP:Chol-fus1 is a drug that helps transfer the fus1 gene into cancer cells. It is thought that the absence of the fus1 gene may be involved in the development of lung cancer tumors. The idea is to try to replace this gene in lung cancer cells. Participants in this study must have advanced lung cancer that has worsened after receiving prior chemotherapy. Before treatment begins participants will have a physical exam. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine tests will be performed. Women able to have children will have a blood pregnancy test. Please note that it is possible that the tumor could cause a ""positive"" pregnancy test result when you are not pregnant. If a pregnancy test comes back positive and for any reason you and/or the research staff believes that this may be an error additional tests may be done to confirm or rule out pregnancy. The participant's tumor will be measured using CT PET/CT or MRI scans. Participants will also have an EKG (heart function test) and a MUGA scan or echocardiogram. A treatment cycle on this study is 3 weeks. Participants will receive pre-medications of dexamethasone and diphenhydramine prior to the infusion of DOTAP:Chol-fus1 to try to lessen the potential reactions to the infusion. The participant will receive a short infusion of DOTAP:Chol-fus1 by vein once every 3 weeks. Participants will be examined by their doctor before each treatment. In addition participants will return to the clinic on days 2 3 and 8 after the first dose to have blood tests done their vital signs checked and to look for side effects. After every two treatment cycles or 6 weeks the participant's tumor will be measured using a CT or MRI scan. Participants can continue to receive treatments until the tumor gets worse side effects become too severe or a maximum of 6 treatments have been given. Treatment may continue for participants who continue to benefit from the treatment at the end of the planned 6 treatments if the treating physician the principle investigator and an advisor from the FDA all agree. Participants will return to the clinic 3 weeks after their last dose of DOTAP:Chol-fus1 to have their vital signs checked and to look for side effects. After all treatments are finished participants will be contacted every 3 months for an update on their health and to gather information about any other treatment(s) they have received. Participants entered at a given dose level will not be able to receive a higher dose while on study. A group of 3 participants will receive DOTAP:Chol-fus1 by vein at each dose level. After treating 3 participants at a given dose level the participants will be observed for 2 weeks to evaluate the toxicity. The information showing if the participants develop severe side effects referred to as dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be recorded for computing the chance of toxicity. This information will be used to help select the dose level for the next group of participants. The goal is to find the dose level where 10% of participants develop severe side effects (dose-limiting toxicity). All the participants will be treated in a dose-escalation fashion starting from the lowest level. The next dose level can be moved up if calculation of the side effects shows that a higher dose is needed. However no skipping of doses is allowed. This is an investigational study. Up to 51 individuals will receive study drug on this study. All will be enrolled at M. D.

(phase III closed to accrual as of 12/31/05) OUTLINE: This is a randomized multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (60 and under vs over 60) and time since induction therapy (90 days or less vs 91-180 days vs 181-240 days). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) once daily 5 days a week. Treatment continues for 2 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients undergo PCI once daily 5 days a week. Treatment continues for 2.6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. - Arm III: Patients undergo PCI twice daily 5 days a week. Treatment continues for 3.4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline every 6 months for 1 year and then annually for 3 years. Patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year and then annually for 3 years.

132,1074,NCT00059618,Completed,Bortezomib is a drug that turns off certain genes and proteins inside the cancer cell that are responsible for cell growth. Researchers believe that when certain genes and proteins are turned off the ability of the cancer cell to survive is decreased. Before treatment starts participants will have a complete checkup blood tests a urine test a heart test a chest x-ray and either a CT scan or MRI scan. Women able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test within 14 days of beginning treatment. Blood tests and a complete checkup will also be done before each course of therapy and a month after treatment ends. Approximately 2-3 teaspoons of blood will be obtained for routine blood tests each time blood is drawn during this study. Participants in this study will receive Bortezomib and carboplatin through a catheter (tube) placed in a vein. This is Day 1 of therapy. Bortezomib is given first (over 5 to 10 seconds) followed by carboplatin (over one hour). Bortezomib is then given alone on Days 4 8 and 11. There is no treatment given on Days 12-28. One course of therapy is 28 days long and includes one dose of carboplatin and 4 doses of Bortezomib. All treatment is given on an outpatient basis at M. D. Anderson. There are 4 different dose levels of Bortezomib being studied. The dose of Bortezomib that participants receive will depend on when they are enrolled. It will also depend on whether or not other participants had side effects from their treatment. Up to 6 patients could be treated at each dose. Before each course of therapy participants will have a physical exam and blood tests. A CT scan or MRI scan is repeated after Cycles 2 and 4 and at the end of treatment. Participants who have a partial or complete response (the tumor shrinks by more than 50% or disappears completely) will have a repeat CT or MRI 4 weeks later to confirm the response. Participants may receive up to 8 courses of treatment. If the disease gets worse or if intolerable side effects occur participants will be taken off study. This is an investigational study. Bortezomib is approved for use by the FDA in patients with multiple myeloma. Carboplatin is approved by the FDA though its use with Bortezomib is experimental. A total of 24 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D.

Chemotherapy given for prior cancers will not exclude patients from participating in this study. - Patients with previously documented human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV-positive patients are excluded from the study based on theoretical concerns regarding the effect of PS-341 on certain aspects of immune function. NF-KB is a critical T cell activation protein (including through CD40L/CD 154 stimulation) and also is involved in cytokine production. Because PS 341 effectively blocks NF-KB and therefore could reduce or block the ability of T lymphocytes and other immune cells to fight HIV PS-341 should not be administered to HIV-positive patients. Additional experiments in animal models are being conducted to better elucidate the effects of PS-341 on HIV. - Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active infection symptomatic congestive heart failure unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia. - Other serious medical or psychiatric illness that could in the investigator's opinion potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol. - Patients who are pregnant suspected to be pregnant or breast-feeding. - Patients with a known hypersensitivity to PS-341 boron or mannitol.,Female,, , ,facility:University of Texas M.

146,1154,NCT00059761,Completed,OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan administered with cisplatin and thoracic radiotherapy (given at two different schedules) in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and non-dose-limiting toxicity of these regimens in these patients. - Determine the reversibility of all toxic effects associated with these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized dose-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 radiotherapy (RT) treatment groups. - Radiotherapy: - Group I: Patients undergo thoracic RT twice daily 5 days a week for 3 weeks. - Group II: Patients undergo thoracic RT once daily 5 days a week for 7 weeks. - Concurrent chemotherapy: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 60-90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 1 course for group I and 2 courses for group II. - Post RT chemotherapy: Patients receive irinotecan and cisplatin as above for 3 courses for group I and 2 courses beginning after RT is complete for group II. Sequential cohorts of 6 patients per group receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then 6 months for 4 years.

158,1186,NCT00059631,Completed,"Mitoxantrone is used to treat bone pain in advanced prostate cancer and inhibits many proteins that the cancer cells need to multiply. Bortezomib is a member of a new class of drugs that possess powerful and broad-spectrum anti-tumor activity and inhibit many proteins that the cancer cells need to survive and multiply. Pre-study testing will include brief physical examination vital signs (weight height temperature pulse respiratory and blood pressure) chest x-ray EKG (test to measure the electrical activity of the heart) echocardiogram blood test urine tests and depending on the stage of the disease a CT scan and/or bone scan. During treatment the participants will receive one dose of Mitoxantrone combined with one dose of Bortezomib every week for 4 weeks in a row followed by 2 weeks of rest; this is called a course. If side effects are not too severe Mitoxantrone and Bortezomib will be infused rapidly into a vein while participants will be receiving normal saline (""salt in water solution"") at a rate of 100ml/hour. They will receive the salt solution the entire time they are in the treatment area. Participants will have their vital signs (temperature pulse breathing blood pressure) taken before and one hour after treatment. All side effects during course one will be reviewed and if no serious side effects took place the participant may have additional courses. A pill may be given by mouth every day to decrease the risk of clot formation or a pill for diarrhea nausea and/or vomiting if the doctor believes that participants may need it. Also during treatment participants will have a complete physical examination by a physician or their designated representative (such as a nurse or physician assistant) each week of treatment. Bone Scan and/or CT Scan will be done if necessary. Participants will have blood tests done every week during study. A special blood test called the 20S proteosome will be done weekly during Cycles 1 and 2 to evaluate the activity of the drugs. Blood will be collected before you receive treatment and then at 1-2 hours afterward. About 2 teaspoons of blood will be collected each time for this. Bone scan chest x-ray and/or CT scans will be repeated during the study every other course. Participants will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.

188,1301,NCT00059787,Completed,PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish whether the addition of OSI-774 (Tarceva) to the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin encourages pathologic complete response (pCR) rates in patients with Stage III optimally cytoreduced (stratum 1) and Stage III suboptimally cytoreduced or Stage IV (stratum 2) ovarian primary peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinomas when used as front line therapy. II. To determine the degree and type of toxicity associated with this combined regimen. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish baseline epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) truncated EGFR (EGFRvIII) phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR) and related signal transduction pathway protein expression levels (such as the mitogen activated protein kinase p-ERK AKT phosphorylation and Her2/neu) in tumor samples obtained pretreatment and to correlate these with achieving pCR. II. To describe changes in EGFR EGFRvIII pEGFR expression levels and other related signal transduction pathway expression occurring during treatment with OSI-774 in combination with chemotherapy. III. To determine the effect of the addition of OSI-774 (Tarceva) to the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin on progression-free interval in patients with Stage III optimally cytoreduced (stratum 1) and Stage III suboptimally cytoreduced or Stage IV (stratum 2) ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinomas when used as front line therapy. IV. To determine the tolerability of twelve months of maintenance treatment with OSI-774 for patients achieving pCR and to measure the progression-free interval for this population. V. To document cutaneous effects of OSI 774 prospectively and to correlate the degree of skin rash with clinical and translational endpoints. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage (stage III with optimal residual disease vs stage III with suboptimal residual disease or stage IV). Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive oral erlotinib daily. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a pathologic complete response those initially suboptimally debulked with a response and patients who elect not to undergo surgical reassessment but who achieve a complete clinical response receive maintenance erlotinib for an additional 12 months.,Brenner Tumor;Fallopian Tube Cancer;Ovarian Clear Cell Cystadenocarcinoma;Ovarian Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma;Ovarian Mucinous Cystadenocarcinoma;Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma;Ovarian Undifferentiated Adenocarcinoma;Stage III Ovarian Epithelial Cancer;Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Cancer,,2010-05-01,,Treatment,Inclusion Criteria: - Patients with a histologic diagnosis of primary peritoneal carcinoma fallopian tube epithelial ovarian carcinoma Stage III with either greater than 1 cm (suboptimal) residual disease following initial surgery or Stage IV; all patients must either have had appropriate surgery for ovarian fallopian tube or peritoneal carcinoma with appropriate tissue available for histologic evaluation to confirm diagnosis and stage or must be unresectable at time of diagnosis (to be determined by gynecological oncologist); cytology alone is not adequate - Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: Serous adenocarcinoma endometrioid adenocarcinoma mucinous adenocarcinoma undifferentiated carcinoma clear cell adenocarcinoma mixed epithelial carcinoma transitional cell carcinoma malignant Brenner's Tumor or adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS) - Patients must begin chemotherapy on this study no more than twelve weeks postoperatively - Patients must not have received chemotherapy within five years prior to enrollment - ECOG performance status =< 2 (Karnofsky >= 60%) - Absolute neutrophil count >= 1 500/uL - Platelets >= 100 000/uL - Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal - AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =< 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal - Creatinine =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal OR creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal - Neuropathy (sensory and motor) =< CTC grade 1 - No medical contraindications to planned regimen - Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Exclusion Criteria: - Patients who have had courses of chemotherapy within the five years prior to entering the study - Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents - Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events - History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition OSI-774 or other agents used in the study - Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active infection symptomatic congestive heart failure unstable angina pectoris cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements - Pregnant women are excluded from this study because OSI-774 has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with OSI-774 breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with OSI-774; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study - Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with OSI-774 or other agents administered during the study; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated,Female,,18 Years, ,facility:Montefiore Medical Center|Bronx|New York|10467-2490|United States,United States,

190,1305,NCT00054067,Terminated,OBJECTIVES: - Compare progression-free survival and survival of patients with stage IB2 carcinoma of the cervix after radical hysterectomy with tailored chemoradiotherapy vs primary chemoradiotherapy. - Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the health-related quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: (Surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy): Patients undergo exploratory laparotomy followed by radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Depending on the findings at surgery the radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy are either completed or aborted. - Aborted hysterectomy: Patients with aborted hysterectomy are assigned to 1 of 3 groups depending on the findings at surgery. - Group 1: Within 4 weeks of surgery patients undergo pelvic radiotherapy 5 times weekly for 4-6 weeks and intracavitary irradiation during or after external radiotherapy. Patients also receive concurrent cisplatin IV over 1 hour once weekly for a total of 5-6 doses. - Group 2: Patients receive radiotherapy and cisplatin as in group 1 with additional extended field radiotherapy. - Group 3: Patients receive further treatment at the discretion of the investigator. - Completed hysterectomy: Patients completing the radical hysterectomy are assigned to 1 of 3 groups depending on the findings at surgery. - Group A: Patients receive treatment as in group 1 above without intracavity irradiation. - Group B: Patients receive treatment as in group 2 above without intracavity irradiation. - Group C: Patients receive no further treatment. - Arm II (Primary chemoradiotherapy): Patients undergo pelvic radiotherapy 5 times weekly for 4-6 weeks and intracavity irradiation during or after external radiotherapy. Patients also receive concurrent cisplatin IV over 1 hour once weekly for a total of 6 doses. Quality of life is assessed at baseline during week 5 of therapy and then at 3 6 and 12 months. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years every 6 months for 3 years and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 740 patients (370 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 7.5 years.,Cervical Cancer,cervical adenocarcinoma;cervical adenosquamous cell carcinoma;cervical squamous cell carcinoma;stage IB cervical cancer,,,Treatment,DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: -

201,1353,NCT00050167,Completed,Before the study participants will have a complete physical exam including blood tests and a chest x-ray. A mammogram and a sonogram of the breast and armpit will be done to record tumor size (for patients who have not had surgery). Sonography of the liver or a CT scan of the abdomen will also be done. In some patients who have not had surgery 3-4 samples of the breast tumor will be taken to help confirm the diagnosis of breast cancer. A biopsy needle will be used to collect the samples. During the study participants will have blood tests done before each dose of chemotherapy. For participants who have not had surgery a mammogram and sonogram will be done of the breast and armpit after completion of paclitaxel or docetaxel/capecitabine and after completion of fluorouracil cyclophosphamide and epirubicin (FEC). These studies will help doctors to keep track of the tumor size and help with the final decision whether to remove all or part of the breast and nearby lymph nodes after completion of chemotherapy. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of two treatment groups. There is an equal chance of being in either group. Participants in Group I will receive paclitaxel once a week. The drug will be given through a plastic tube in a vein over 1 hour for a total of 12 treatments. Before each treatment patients will receive the drug Decadron (dexamethasone) through the vein and may receive Zofran (ondansetron) Benadryl (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) and/or cimetidine to help decrease the risk of side effects from paclitaxel. Participants in Group II will receive docetaxel and capecitabine. Docetaxel will be given once every 3 weeks. Docetaxel will be given through a plastic tube in the vein over 1 hour. Capecitabine will be started the same day docetaxel is given. This medicine is given in a pill form. The doctor will prescribe a dose of these pills based upon body weight and height. Participants will take several pills two times a day for 14 days. Participants will then not take any capecitabine pills for one week until the next dose of docetaxel is given. This combination of docetaxel and capecitabine will be given four times (over a period of 12 weeks). Before each treatment patients will receive the drug Decadron (dexamethasone) by mouth. After treatment with either paclitaxel or docetaxel/capecitabine all participants will receive the drugs FEC through a plastic tube into a vein. All of these drugs will be given once every three weeks for a total of 4 treatments (12 weeks total). Decadron (dexamethasone) Zofran (ondansetron) and Benadryl (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) will be given before the chemotherapy to help decrease the risk of side effects. Participants who have a Her-2/neu positive cancer will potentially be eligible to receive trastuzumab therapy for 1 year. This medicine is given through a vein either once a week (over 30 minutes) or once every 3 weeks (over 30 minutes). Your doctor will discuss whether this medicine is appropriate for you. After all treatment is done participants whose tumors are sensitive to hormones (estrogen) will take a pill to help decrease the amount of hormone (estrogen) that can reach any tumor cells. This pill will be taken once a day for 5 years. Participants who have not completed surgery for their cancer before receiving the chemotherapy described above will have surgery to remove all or part of the breast that has cancer. If there are signs that the lymph nodes in the armpit (axilla) contain cancer these lymph nodes will also be removed. After chemotherapy and surgery or after completion of chemotherapy (patients who had surgery done first) participants may then receive radiation treatment to the breast area and armpit once a day (Monday through Friday) for 5-6 weeks. After the study participants will return for checkups every 3-4 months during Years 1 and 2 every 6 months during years 3 and 4 and yearly after that. During the check-ups participants will talk with and be examined by their physician. Once a year patients will have yearly mammograms (as needed) chest-x rays and blood tests. This is an investigational study. All of the drugs in this study are approved by the FDA for treatment of breast cancer. A total of 930 patients will take part in this study.

209,1372,NCT00057252,Enrolling by invitation,Radiologic images are becoming more and more complex and utilization of radiologic techniques is accelerating. Radiologists and other clinicians are being inundated with radiologic data. Computer aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) have the potential to improve patient care by increasing sensitivity of diagnostic tests reducing false positives and improving physician efficiency. Computer aided detection and diagnosis have been under development for many years yet there is still much work to be done to move it from the bench to the bedside. The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate techniques for CAD using the existing radiologic data available in the Clinical Center's Department of Diagnostic Radiology. Such techniques include but are not limited to automated detection of melanoma bone metastases and pulmonary emboli. The outcome of this study will be algorithms and software that accurately detect lesions on radiologic studies.,Cancer,Diagnostic Radiology;Imaging;Algorithms;Healthy Volunteer;HV,,,,- INCLUSION CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria are the availability of radiologic examinations in the clinical PACS (picture archiving system) in the Clinical Center. Existing Patient scans with and without the target lesion will be included. Examples of target lesions include subcutaneous and bone lesions and pulmonary emboli although patient scans with other disorders depicted on radiologic studies may be included when appropriate. Patient scans without the target lesion may be included to determine the specificity of the computer aided detection or diagnosis algorithm.

212,1387,NCT00054691,Completed,"ZD1839 is a new drug that may slow or stop cell growth in humans. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) may be involved in certain types of cancer including squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. When EGFR is stimulated a series of chemical reactions starts that results in a tumor being ""told"" to grow. ZD1839 tries to stop these reactions by blocking EGFR. This may stop tumors from growing. In this study participants will take ZD1839 by mouth daily. Once the treatment has started participants will return to the clinic before every treatment cycle (every 4 weeks) for the first 4 months then every 8 weeks thereafter. At these visits participants will have a physical exam and blood tests will be performed. About 2-4 teaspoons of blood will be drawn at each visit. The doctor will also check on how participants are tolerating ZD1839 (side effects). Every 8 weeks participants will have their tumor evaluated by radiographic scans. This may include either a CT or MRI and a chest X-ray. During treatment participants should not take any other medication including non-prescription drugs such as aspirin or herbal products without the approval of their doctor. Participants will continue taking the trial drug until the tumor grows a severe side effect occurs they withdraw consent or the study is closed. The study will be closed 12 months after the last participant is enrolled. This is an investigational study. The FDA has approved ZD1839 for the treatment of advanced lung cancer but the FDA has authorized ZD1839 for research only in the treatment of skin cancer. About 40 participants will take part in this study.

229,1456,NCT02190279,Completed,Background - Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. - Current methods of imaging advanced prostate cancer (CT and bone scan) are non specific and new more specific molecular imaging probes are sought. - Many prostate cancers express the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) a transmembrane protein with NAALADase enzymatic activity. PSMA is also expressed in angiogenesis but otherwise has limited expression in normal tissue. - 18F-DCFBC is a radiolabeled PET agent which binds with high affinity to PSMA and through whole-body non-invasive functional imaging may provide new information on the expression of PSMA. Primary Objective - To assess the ability of 18F-DCFBC to differentiate between tumorous and nontumorous tissues in localized recurrent (based on rising PSA post treatment) and metastatic prostate cancer Eligibility - Subject is greater than or equal to 18 years old - ECOG 0-2 with adenocarcinoma of the prostate and fits criteria for one of the following: - ARM 1 -- Patients with known localized prostate cancer with a soft tissue lesion at least 6mm or greater. ---A multiparametric MRI (standard of care at the NIH Clinical Center) must be performed within 4 months of18F-DCFBC injection with findings suggestive for prostate cancer and confirmed with histopathology. - ARM 2 - Patients with biochemical prostate cancer relapse after definitive treatment - For patients status post radiation therapy for prostate cancer a PSA increase from post radiation therapy nadir - OR - For patients status post prostatectomy any PSA >/=0.2 ng/ml - Nonspecific or no evidence for disease on standard imaging modality - ARM 3 - Patients with identifiable metastatic disease on a conventional imaging modality.

231,1490,NCT02193347,Recruiting,After informed consent has been signed subjects will undergo standard of care vaccination with 0.5 mL of Td (tetanus and diphtheria toxoids adsorbed) intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle to ensure adequate immunity to the tetanus antigen. Eligible subjects will undergo a 1-2 hour leukapheresis (to pull off white blood cells) for immune monitoring. Within 48 hours of leukapheresis subjects will receive vaccine site pre-conditioning as a single dose of Td toxoid (in a total volume of 0.4 mLs salt water/saline) given in the intradermal space (just under the surface of the skin) to the right groin area. The pre-conditioning will be administered one day prior to receiving PEPIDH1M vaccine. The peptide vaccine is administered in the upper thigh area approximately 4 inches below the groin in the intradermal space as vaccine # 1. Subsequent vaccines will be given on day 15 ±3 days (vaccine #2) and day 29 ±3 days (vaccine #3). Each injection of the peptide vaccine will be given half on the right groin and half on the left groin. The first 3 peptide vaccine injections will occur without temozolomide (standard of care chemotherapy). Seven to twelve days after the 3rd vaccine subjects will have standard of care surgery to remove the tumor. Tumor samples will be evaluated for the IDH1 markers and analyzed for other cells that may have entered the tumor. Based on the the tissue obtained at surgery subjects with stable histologic grade at recurrence will then be treated with vaccine and temozolomide. During monthly cycles of temozolomide subjects will receive the vaccine on day 22 (+ 2 days) for a maximum of 15 total vaccines (which includes the first 3 bi-weekly vaccines). Patients that have transitioned to a higher grade brain tumor at the time of surgery will receive temozolomide and radiation therapy per standard of care and monthly vaccines (vaccines #4-6). After completion of radiation therapy subjects in this treatment group will receive vaccines monthly on day 22 (+2 days) with post-RT cycles of TMZ to a maximum of 15 vaccines. All Adverse Events will be collected from time of consent until off study. The treatment phase of the study will end 1 month after the last vaccine. Patients will be followed only for overall survival progression-free survival and subsequent therapies thereafter. Subjects will have blood collected for immune monitoring and biomarker testing during the following times: prior to initiating vaccine therapy (at the leukapheresis visit) prior to surgery to remove the tumor at the clinic visit prior to starting first cycle of temozolomide after surgery (or radiation therapy and temozolomide for those who transition to higher grade) at vaccine #6 and at end of vaccine treatment (1 month after vaccine #15 or time the subject comes off study whichever comes first). Subjects will be imaged with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to standard of care every 10 weeks (+/- 4 weeks) while on temozolomide and afterward per the treating neuro-oncologist's recommendation. Revised Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria will be used for assessment of pseudoprogression and tumor progression. Subjects demonstrating definitive progression will be removed from study. As part of standard care for these subjects upon tumor progression participants may undergo biopsy or resection. As this is not a research procedure consent will be obtained separately. Subjects that have this procedure done within the Duke University Health System will be asked to have a portion of the tumor sample if possible to assess immunologic cell infiltration antigen expression and biomarkers for immunologic response.,Brain Cancer;Brain Neoplasm Primary;Brain Neoplasms Recurrent;Brain Tumor;Cancer of the Brain,Immunotherapy;Adult,2019-06-01,,Treatment,Inclusion Criteria: 1.

234,1517,NCT02191982,Completed,The investiagors propose to evaluate the impact of a home-based self-directed walking program on post-chemotherapy fatigue among 150 cancer survivors age 65 and older -- Senior Physical Activity after Chemotherapy (S-PACT). Participants must have potentially curable cancer moderate to severe fatigue (score of 4 or higher on the Brief Fatigue Inventory) currently exercise less than 120 minutes per week and have completed chemotherapy treatment (radiation treatment must also be completed if it is part of the patient's treatment plan) within the last 6 weeks. The design is a randomized controlled trial with participants randomized to a 3-month physical activity program (intervention group) or to wait-list control (this group begins the walking program at 3 months post-randomization). The primary objective is to compare the change in fatigue scores from baseline to 3 months between the intervention and wait-list control groups.,Cancer;Geriatric;Fatigue,Cancer;Chemotherapy;Fatigue;Elderly;Geriatric;Any Cancer;Cancer Treatment;Weakness;Tiredness,2017-08-01,,Treatment,Inclusion Criteria: - Men and women age 65 years and older - Histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer (hematologic or solid) at stage considered amenable to cure as assessed by the treating MD - Within 6 weeks of end of chemotherapy (all participants must have had chemotherapy treatment) - Any radiation received must also be completed prior to randomization (if radiation treatment follows adjuvant chemotherapy then the patient must be recruited within 6 weeks of end of radiation) - Maintenance hormonal therapy in women with breast cancer is allowed; see exclusion criteria regarding hormonal therapy in males with prostate cancer - Moderate to severe fatigue (>4 on BFI) - Less than 120 minutes/week of physical activity - English speaking - Signed IRB approved written informed consent - Approval from their treating physician to engage in moderate-intensity physical activity - Patient-assessed ability to walk and engage in moderate physical activity - Willing and able to meet all study requirements.

235,1534,NCT02192918,Completed,Melanoma is the second most common cancer diagnosed in young women and is responsible for nearly 8 000 US deaths per year. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) increases risk for melanoma. The International Agency for Research on Cancer assigned indoor tanning (IT; use of tanning beds or booths) as a class 1 carcinogen joining arsenic asbestos and mustard gas. Unfortunately interventions educating tanners about the risks have not been very effective. Many tanners are more motivated by the immediate consequences of tanning than the delayed consequence of possibly getting cancer. Research shows the primary motivation for indoor tanning is to improve physical appearance but a secondary motivation is stress reduction. Behavioral economics theory suggests that the rate of a behavior depends on 1) the reinforcing value of that behavior relative to alternatives 2) the cost of engaging in the behavior relative to alternatives and 3) the availability of the behavior relative to alternatives. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether exposure to healthy alternatives changes the behavior of indoor tanners. The investigators will randomize tanners to conditions differing in physical appearance and stress reduction alternatives to determine whether they can get their motivational needs met in healthier ways.,Skin Cancer,,2015-04-01,,Prevention,Inclusion Criteria: - Female - Ages 16-65 - Report minimum of 10 indoor tanning visits in the last year with intentions to continue Exclusion Criteria: - Ages <16 or >65 - Pregnant breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant during the study period - Reporting less than 10 indoor tanning visits per year - No intention to continue indoor tanning - Using sunless tanning more than once in the last year and ever in the last 3 months - Physically limited to do yoga or dance classes - DHA allergy - Inability to consent - Prisoners,Female,,16 Years,65 Years,facility:University of Massachusetts Medical School|Worcester|Massachusetts|01655|United States,United States,

240,1595,NCT02190539,Enrolling by invitation,- Homeopathy is a controversial system of care and at the center of the controversy lays the question of whether high dilution remedies can be effective. There have been only a handful of high quality studies of homeopathy on the treatment of cancer despite its widespread use for this condition. In a recent prospective observational study done in Germany with cancer patients in two differently treated cohorts it was observed that an improvement in quality of life was observed in patients taking the addition of homeopathic treatment. In the laboratory research on homeopathy and cancer that does exist is limited but has some clues for effects that cannot be ignored. A study that was conducted at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center revealed that four ultradilute remedies (Carcinosin Phytolacca Conium and Thuja) exerted preferential cytotoxic effects against two breast cancer cell lines causing cell cycle delay/arrest and apoptosis without affecting the normal mammary epithelial cells. Since patients with advanced breast cancer are the highest CAM users amongst patients affected by cancer it was thought that a feasibility study with this group of patients would be a rational first step in proceeding to evaluate this controversial method of care if it has merit or not. - The objective of this study is to conduct a feasibility study at Meir Oncology Institute examining whether patients with advanced breast cancer would follow a homeopathic protocol for three to six months. The primary aim of the study is to establish if patients with advanced breast cancer in Meir Oncology Institute would follow homeopathic protocol as used by Dr Banerji in India for six months. The secondary aim is to observe the quality of life and wellbeing of patients undergoing this protocol. - Patients with the diagnosis of advanced breast cancer who attend the Meir Oncology Institute clinic will be offered by their treating physician or nurse a fact sheet about this study and will be asked to participate in this protocol. The protocol will be explained to the patient by the research team. If they agree to participate they will be given a consent form to sign and basic information will be obtained from each patient. This information will include basic demographics (age marital status employment education level) and basic medical information ( Disease status and progress current symptoms medications and treatments being used complementary medicine being used) as well as evaluation of quality of life using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ). - Patients will receive the selected homeopathic remedies (Carcinosin 30C Phytolacca 200C and Thuja 30C) with written instructions about the proper use of the remedies. The remedies will be offered to patients in addition to their regular conventional care. Patients that cannot participate in conventional cancer care due to side effects expected adverse reactions or other reasons that prevent them from utilizing conventional care will be offered to participate in the study as well. In addition patients who for their own reasons elect to refuse conventional treatment can be offered to participate in the study in order to keep them in the system and not lose them to alternative untested treatments. Every 4 weeks for the period of 3 months and once at 6 months a research assistant/ research nurse will contact each participant to review EORTC QLQ- C-30 questionnaire to evaluate quality of life as well as a follow up questionnaire which will verify the actual use of these remedies perceived problems in taking these remedies utilization of other therapies address patients concerns and document disease progression.

241,1602,NCT02195076,Unknown status,Early detection of cancer can dramatically improve the survival chances. to date there is no efficient diagnostic tool for detection of lung cancer in early stages. Regarding breast cancer the common screening tool us mammography which suffer from low sensitivity and high false positive. Thus there is an urgent need for developing a screening tool for early stages lung and breast cancer. The sense of smell depends on the ability of specialized sensory cells of the nose to perceive volatile compounds (VOCs). Diseases such as infections and malignancies can be associated with changes in host metabolism accompanied by production of different VOCs and thus a different odor. Several studies have shown that different cancers secrete different VOCs thus produce different smell. We have developed a system which uses biosensors that can scent the VOCs that lung and breast cancer cell produce thus distinguish between healthy control and lung or breast cancer. These biosensors can detect low stages lung and breast cancer. Patients will supply urine samples and exhaled breath samples using a kit that we will supply.

243,1623,NCT02194738,Recruiting,PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To centrally test resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for genetic mutations to facilitate accrual to randomized adjuvant studies. II. To obtain clinically annotated tumor tissue and patient-matched non-malignant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from peripheral blood as well as detailed epidemiologic and clinical follow-up data to allow clinically annotated advanced genomic analyses in concert with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the natural history of molecularly characterized NSCLC to allow subsequent development of targeted therapies against genotype-defined subpopulations in the adjuvant and recurrent settings. II. To cross-validate local genotyping assays for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) with a central reference standard. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To study the genomic evolution of lung cancers by comparing genomic characteristics at resection and at recurrence. II. To understand reasons behind lack of enrollment to adjuvant targeted therapy studies for potentially eligible patients. III. To study the clinical significance of circulating tumor DNA within the plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from early stage lung cancer patients. OUTLINE: STEP 1 (SCREENING): Patients undergo collection of blood and tissue samples for EGFR ALK and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) testing via direct sequencing fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Patients that have had surgery prior to pre-registration will submit samples from the previous surgery for testing.

244,1632,NCT02194387,Recruiting,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Survivor: Study Procedures: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study the study staff will schedule a time date and location at MD Anderson for you to receive an accelerometer. The study staff will also provide you with instructions for wearing the accelerometer for 7 days before your visit. You will also wear the accelerometer for the 7 days before your 2nd visit (about 4 months later). You will return the accelerometer at each visit. At the first visit you will receive a Fitbit (a small device you will wear that will track your activity) access to the Fitbit website a Fitbit account with which you can view your information and record diet and non-walking/running physical activity a guidebook and brochures. At these visits: - You will complete multiple fitness tests to measure your strength flexibility balance and endurance. To measure your hand and forearm muscle strength you will squeeze and release your hand on a handgrip tool. You will also complete a 6-minute walk test to measure your endurance. To complete this test you will walk as fast as you can in an indoor hallway for 6 minutes. The distance you walk will be recorded. To measure your flexibility you will do a sit-and-reach test (reaching in front of you) and a back scratch test (reaching behind your back). To assess your lower body strength we will record how many times you can stand up from a chair and sit back down in 30 seconds. To assess your upper body strength we will measure how many arm curls you can do with a dumbbell weight in 30 seconds. To measure your agility and balance we will time how long it takes for you to get up from a chair walk around a cone that is 8 feet away from you and sit back down again. - Blood (about 1½ tablespoons) will be drawn. You must fast have nothing to eat or drink but water for 12 hours before these visits. These samples will be sent to the University of Houston for analysis. Any remaining blood samples will be stored for future testing on biomarkers. We will also request your recent blood results from your doctor in order to compare those results with the blood samples we collect from you. You will not be informed of any findings from the blood tests. - Your height weight and waist and hip circumference will be measured. Each visit will take up to 2 and a half hours. You will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 16 study groups. The study staff will call you to explain which group you are in and which interventions you will receive. The 16 groups will each receive a different combination of each of the 4 following factors: 1. Weekly telephone coaching or email coaching 2. Text messages or no text messages 3. Resistance training or no resistance training 4. 4-7 days/week self-monitoring or one day/week self-monitoring. For example 1 group will receive weekly telephone coaching text messages resistance training and daily self-monitoring; and 1 group will receive email coaching no text messages no resistance training and one day/week self-monitoring. The other 14 groups will receive a combination of each of the 2 different kinds of the 4 factors. You will receive your interventions for 16 weeks. If you receive telephone coaching you will have 30-45 minute telephone calls 1 time each week with a telephone coach trained in motivational interviewing. These calls will be based on your Fitbit data. The coach will discuss your diet and fitness goals with you as well as any difficulty you may be having with meeting your goals. Telephone sessions may be audio recorded for quality control. The audio recordings will be destroyed at the conclusion of the study. If you receive email coaching you will be called during the first week to discuss the interventions. This call will last about 10-15 minutes. You will then receive 1 email each week in weeks 1-16 in which the coach will provide feedback about your goals and ask 1-2 questions similar to what the telephone coach would ask. If you respond to the coach the conversation will continue until you make no further response. If you receive text messaging you will receive 7-12 messages each week that will contain support and/or information about diet and physical activity. If you receive resistance training you will be given a set of resistance exercise bands a list of exercises and instructional videos on how to do each exercise. You will be asked to log your resistance exercises on a weekly activity log. If you are in a 4-7 days/week self-monitoring group you will enter additional information about your diet and weight 4-7 days per week. If you are in a one day/week self-monitoring group you will do this 1 day each week. Study Questionnaires: You will complete online questionnaires at the beginning of the study as well as 8 and 16 weeks after that. The online questionnaires will be sent to you by email text message and/or a letter with a link to the survey. If you prefer to complete a paper questionnaire you may request this when you start the study and the study staff will provide you a paper questionnaire by mail with a self-addressed stamped envelope. In the questionnaires you will record your self-measured height and weight. The questionnaires will also ask you about your demographic information (such as your age) medical history body composition physical activity readiness to change and your general health. These questionnaires should take about 30-45 minutes to complete. You will complete additional online questionnaires to measure your diet called the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ). You will be provided a secure web link with a username and password and instructions on how to complete the questionnaire. This DHQ should take about 45-60 minutes to complete. After your completion of the study you may be contacted by telephone to complete a brief follow-up interview. The interview questions will ask for your feedback about the study and any suggestions for ways to make the study better. Length of Study: Your study participation will be over after you complete the questionnaires at Week 16. Your study participation may be stopped early if you become injured if you become ineligible (for example if you need to have treatment) or if the study staff thinks it is in your best interest. High Risk Families: Study Procedures: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study you will be mailed an accelerometer measuring tape instructions for wearing the accelerometer for 7 days and measuring hip and waist circumference and a return mailer for these items. You will also be mailed a FitBit (a small device you will wear that will track your activity) access to the FitBit website a FitBit account with which you can view your information and record diet and non-walking/running physical activity a guidebook and brochures. You will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 16 study groups. The study staff will call you to explain which group you are in and which interventions you will receive. The 16 groups will each receive a different combination of each of the 4 following factors: 1. Weekly telephone coaching or email coaching 2. Text messages or no text messages 3. Social networking or no social networking 4. 4-7 days/week self-monitoring or one day/week self-monitoring. For example 1 group will receive weekly telephone coaching text messages social networking and daily self-monitoring; and 1 group will receive email coaching no text messages no social networking and one day/week self-monitoring. The other 14 groups will receive a combination of each of the 2 different kinds of the 4 factors. You will receive your interventions for 16 weeks. If you receive telephone coaching you will have 30-45 minute telephone calls 1 time each week with a telephone coach trained in motivational interviewing. These calls will be based on your FitBit data. The coach will discuss your diet and fitness goals with you as well as any difficulty you may be having with meeting your goals.

If you respond to the coach the conversation will continue until you make no further response. If you receive text messaging you will receive 8-12 messages each week that will contain support and/or information about diet and physical activity. If you receive social networking you will be invited to use a private online forum to discuss your goals with other participants in the study who are receiving social networking. At the beginning of the study you will be mailed a Fitbit as well as instructions on how to use it. If you are in a 4-7 days/week self-monitoring group you will enter additional information about your diet and weight 4-7 days per week. If you are in a one day/week self-monitoring group you will do this 1 day each week.

You will have 2 study visits at MD Anderson: at the beginning of the study and at the 4 month time point. At these visits study staff will measure your height weight and waist and hip circumference. You will also return your accelerometer in person at that time. These study visits will last no longer than one hour. At the first visit you will receive a FitBit (a small device you will wear that will track your activity) access to the FitBit website a FitBit account with which you can view your information and record diet and non-walking/running physical activity a guidebook and brochures. You will also be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 16 study groups. The study staff will call you to explain which group you are in and which interventions you will receive. The 16 groups will each receive a different combination of each of the 4 following factors: 1. Weekly telephone coaching or email coaching 2. Text messages or no text messages 3. Social networking or no social networking 4. 4-7 days/week self-monitoring or one day/week self-monitoring. For example 1 group will receive weekly telephone coaching text messages social networking and daily self-monitoring; and 1 group will receive email coaching no text messages no social networking and one day/week self-monitoring. The other 14 groups will receive a combination of each of the 2 different kinds of the 4 factors. You will receive your specific interventions for 16 weeks. If you receive telephone coaching you will have 30-45 minute telephone calls 1 time each week with a telephone coach trained in motivational interviewing. These calls will be based on your Fitbit data. The coach will discuss your diet and fitness goals with you as well as any difficulty you may be having with meeting your goals. Telephone sessions may be audio recorded for quality control. The audio recordings will be destroyed at the conclusion of the study. If you receive email coaching you will be called during the first week to discuss the procedure. This call will last about 10-15 minutes. You will then receive 1 email each week in weeks 1-16 in which the coach will provide feedback about your goals and ask 1-2 questions similar to what the telephone coach would ask. If you respond to the coach the conversation will continue until you make no further response. If you receive text messaging you will receive 8-12 messages each week that will contain support and/or information about diet and physical activity. If you receive social networking you will be invited to use a private online forum to discuss your goals with other participants in the study who are receiving social networking. At the beginning of the study you will be given the Fitbit as well as instructions on how to use it. If you are in a 4-7 days/week self-monitoring group you will enter additional information about your diet and weight 4-7 days per week. If you are in a one day/week self-monitoring group you will do this 1 day each week. Study Questionnaires: You will complete online questionnaires at the beginning of the study as well as 8 and 16 weeks after that. The online questionnaires will be sent to you by email text message and/or a letter with a link to the survey. If you prefer to complete a paper questionnaire you may request this when you start the study and the study staff will provide you a paper questionnaire by mail with a self-addressed stamped envelope. In the questionnaires you will record your self-measured height weight and waist and hip measurements. The questionnaires will also ask you about your demographic information (such as your age) medical history body composition physical activity diet readiness to change and your general health. These questionnaires should take about 30-45 minutes to complete. Length of Study: Your study participation will be over after you complete the questionnaire at the 4 month time point. Your study participation may be stopped early if you become injured if you become ineligible (for example if you need to have treatment) or if the study staff thinks it is in your best interest.,Breast Cancer;Ovarian Cancer,Breast Cancer;Ovarian Cancer;Triple negative breast cancer;TNBC;BRCA-positive survivor;High-grade serous ovarian cancer;HGSOC;Female biological relative of a BRCA positive TNBC or HGSOC survivor;Cancer survivors;Employees at MD Anderson;Multi-phase Optimization Strategy;MOST;Energy balance interventions;EB;Telephone Coaching;Text Messaging;Resistance Training;Daily Self-Monitoring;Weekly Self-Monitoring;Email Coaching;Questionnaires;Surveys,2019-09-01,,Prevention,Inclusion Criteria: 1.

257,1865,NCT02197897,Recruiting,Patients with primary or recurrent low/intermediate-risk papillary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder will undergo resection of all but one marker lesion measuring at least 6mm but no greater than 10mm and biopsy of normal-appearing mucosa. Patients with a solitary tumor will undergo only biopsy prior to treatment. A 2mm cold cup biopsy of the marker lesion will always be performed to rule out a potential high-grade lesion and for assessment of pretreatment immunohistochemistry expression levels of ERα ERβ1 Ki-67 (proliferation marker) and TUNEL (apoptosis marker). If there are multiple tumors all lesions except the marker lesion will be resected and sent for analysis. These patients will not receive single immediate post-operative intravesical instillation of mitomycin-C. They will then undergo a 12-week course of treatment with tamoxifen administered as a single daily oral dose of 20mg. At the completion of therapy patients will undergo resection of the marker lesion (or biopsy of the tumor bed if a complete response is observed) and biopsy of normal-appearing bladder mucosa again. Toxicity evaluations will be performed at the beginning (day 3) midway (week 6) and at completion of treatment (week 12) prior to resection of the marker lesion. A final assessment for toxicity will also be performed 30 days after completion of therapy as well as a second definitive resection of the marker lesion. Urine samples will be obtained with the index tumor in place (marker lesion) and after completion of treatment at the time of definitive transurethral resection of the index tumor as part of the standard clinical care of these patients and at the discretion of the surgeon for assessment of urinary cytology. The urine samples will not be utilized for the research study. All normal-appearing bladder biopsies (pre and post-treatment) the additional tumors (in case of multiple lesions) and the definitive resection of the marker lesion (in the absence of response to therapy) will provide sufficient material for immunohistochemistry assessment of the expression levels of ERα ERβ-1 ERβ-2 ERβ-5 Ki-67 and TUNEL and also for RT-qPCR for mRNA analyses of ERα ERβ-1 ERβ-2 and ERβ-5. The pretreatment biopsy of the marker lesion will be performed with a smaller biopsy forceps and will provide limited material sufficient only for immunohistochemistry assessment of the expression levels of ERα ERβ-1 Ki-67 and TUNEL.,Bladder Cancer,Tamoxifen citrate;Bladder Cancer,2018-07-01,,Treatment,Inclusion Criteria: Males and females age 21 or older.

259,1895,NCT02193633,Unknown status,This is a multi-centre Phase I clinical trial of the combination of AZD2014 and weekly paclitaxel. Two intermittent BD dosing schedules of AZD2014 in combination with paclitaxel will be evaluated. The 3 days on 4 days off schedule will examine 3 continuous days of AZD2014 per week in combination with weekly paclitaxel. The 2 days on 5 days off schedule will examine 2 sequential days of AZD2014 dosing in combination with weekly paclitaxel. For both schedules a dose escalation 3+3 design will be used to establish the MTD and the recommended Phase II dose. Approximately 15 patients with solid tumours will be entered into each schedule during the dose escalation of this phase. The expansion part of the trial will be used to further assess the tolerability of AZD2014 in combination with weekly paclitaxel. For the 3 days on 4 days off schedule 10 patients with ovarian cancer and 15 patients with squamous lung cancer will be enrolled and treated at the MTD established from the dose escalation phase. Accrual to these expansion arms may commence as soon as the MTD is determined and proceed in parallel with the dose escalation phase of the 2 days on 5 days off schedule. Once the MTD has been determined for the 2 days on 5 days off schedule 15 patients with squamous lung cancer may be enrolled.

260,1899,NCT02198690,Active  not recruiting,Women aged 75 and older are the fastest growing segment of the US population and breast cancer incidence increases with age. However none of the randomized trials of mammography screening included women >74 years and it is not known if mammography helps these women live longer. Increasingly data suggest that women need around 10 year life expectancy to have a chance at a mortality benefit from being screened with mammography. Meanwhile there are immediate harms to screening older women including: pain anxiety complications from tests after a false positive mammogram (e.g. breast biopsy) and overdiagnosis (finding tumors that otherwise would never have caused symptoms in one's lifetime). Overdiagnosis is particularly concerning since some older women experience significant complications from breast cancer treatment. Guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend mammography screening for women aged 75 years or older and encourage clinicians to discuss the uncertainty about the balance of benefits and harms with older women. Yet few older women are informed of potential harms of mammography before being screened likely because explaining such uncertainty can be challenging and time consuming. To improve older women's understanding of the benefits and risks of mammography screening investigators previously developed and pilot tested a pamphlet decision aid (DA) on mammography screening for women aged 75+ years. The pilot pretest/posttest trial of 45 women 75+ years found that the DA resulted in older women being more knowledgeable about the benefits and risks of mammography clearer in their values and fewer intended to be screened especially those with <10 year life expectancy. Investigators now propose a large cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the DA using primary care physician (PCP) as the unit of randomization to definitively evaluate the DA's efficacy. The investigators aim to recruit 550 women 75-89 years from 100 PCPs who provide care at an academic primary care or geriatrics practice in Boston three community practices in the Boston metro area or at an academic internal medicine or family practice in North Carolina. Patient participants will either receive the DA (intervention arm) or an educational pamphlet on home safety for older adults (control arm). The investigators chose to use PCPs as the unit of randomization rather than individual patients because they anticipate that some patients will share the DA with their PCPs. Once PCPs are exposed to the DA for one patient they could change their approach to screening which could lead to contamination of the control group making it more difficult to show an effect of the DA. Aims: The investigators will examine and evaluate the impact of providing information on benefits and risks of mammography screening to women aged 75 and older on: 1. receipt of screening; 2. intentions of being screened; 3. knowledge of the pros and cons of being screened; 4. decisional conflict around screening; 5. preferred decision-making role around mammography (active vs. passive/shared with physician); 6. documented discussions by PCPs of the risks and benefits of mammography screening in participants' notes.,Breast Cancer Screening,Mammography  Older women  decision making,2021-08-01,,Health Services Research,Inclusion Criteria: - English-speaking women - Aged 75 to 89 years - Scheduled for a routine visit or physical with their PCP in the next 4-12 weeks - Women who have not had a mammogram in 6 months but have had one in 2 years.

262,1907,NCT02193152,Recruiting,There has been a limited benefit from anti-angiogenesis drugs in patients with NSCLC. Bevacizumab provides a modest survival improvement when added to chemotherapy and VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been associated with minimal efficacy as single agents and increased toxicity when combined with chemotherapy. We postulate that the response rates and survival may be improved with a better selection of patients based on abnormalities of the targets for the drugs. According to the preliminary data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) the targets of pazopanib are altered in 28% of patients with adenocarcinoma and 24% of patients with squamous cell lung cancer. Since despite the molecular selection prior to treatment only a small percentage of patients will benefit from the treatment we plan to further investigate those patients with whole exome sequencing in both the pre-treatment samples to identify the predictors for response and at the time of progression with repeated biopsy in an attempt to identify the predictors for secondary resistance. By identifying more reliable predictors for response to pazopanib our study may help to establish its role in the treatment of NSCLC.,Carcinoma Non-Small Cell Lung;Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer;Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer,Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer;NSCLC;Pazopanib,2019-03-31,,Treatment,Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced (metastatic or unresectable) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mutations rearrangement and fusion involving RET oncogene or abnormalities in the pazopanib target genes defined as VEGFR1-3 PDGFRA PDGFRB or TP53 with abnormalities including deletion insertion early stop codon and/or nonsynonymous mutations with functional consequences.

269,2052,NCT02190071,Completed,1. background 1. Pancreatic cancer is the challenging malignancy in diagnosis and treatment. 2. Recently EUS-FNA has played a important role in diagnosing pancreatic cancer. 3. Samples from EUS-FNA are sent to following three types of preparations. - cytologic smear (by pull apart method) - cell block - histologic biopsy 4. In cytologic smear method endoscopists tend to send as many as slides while pathologists want minimal slides if they warrant diagnostic accuracy. 5. Therefore we are going to find a point of contact between high diagnostic yield and minimal overloading of pathologist. 2. Method 1. We are going to enrolled the patients who were suspected of pancreatic cancer in previous radiologic test. 2. One identical and skilled endoscopist performs EUS-FNA with multiple punctures. 3. We get total 8 pairs of slides (= 8 covers + 8 bases). 4. All the cover slides are collected to the bottle-A all the base slide to the bottle-B. 5. One identical and skilled pathologist inspects these slide in blind method. (She cannot show the label of bottle so that she does not know what bottle is A or B.) 6. She record the positive or negative in each bottle. (If there is only one slide is positive in malignant cell the bottle is positive.) 7. In these manner we collect the all subjects' cytopathologic results as a pair of outcome. All the possible combinations are following four examples: - (cover/base) = (positive/positive) = (+/+) - (cover/base) = (positive/negative) = (+/-) - (cover/base) = (negative/positive) = (-/+) - (cover/base) = (negative/negative) = (-/-) 8. Then we are going to take a two-sided non-inferiority test of proportion using McNemar's test.,Pancreatic Cancer,EUS-FNA;cytopathology;slide smear,2016-03-01,,,Inclusion Criteria: - patients who were suspected of pancreatic cancer in previous radiologic test such as computed tomography magnetic resonance imaging or Positron Emission Tomography.

You will be given the option to take part in the couple-based Hatha Yoga program (off study) after you finish your last questionnaire packet. You and the patient will have about a 1 in 2 chance of being assigned to each group (as in the flip of a coin). The groups are randomly assigned but the assignment will also depend on the age sex and status of disease of the patient. Yoga Sessions: If you are in Group 1 you will take part in up to 15 sessions of Hatha yoga with the patient over the course of radiation therapy (2-3 weekly sessions). Each 45- to 60-minute session will be guided by an instructor. You should attend each session with the patient. During the yoga sessions you will be asked to do deep-breathing exercises and perform different stretching and movement exercises. The movements are designed not to be difficult and you will sit on the floor or in a chair while you do them. You can move through the exercises at your own pace. The instructor will be available to answer any question you may have about the practice of Hatha yoga. Most of the yoga sessions may be videotaped. This is so the researchers can keep track of the quality of the sessions. Only the study staff will be able to view this videotape. The video files are digital and will be deleted after all the data are studied. At your fifth session you will be given a CD and instructions for practicing Hatha yoga at home. While the patient is receiving radiation therapy you will be asked to practice at home 1 time a day either with him/her or alone on the days you do not have a session at the clinic. Your answers to the questions will not be shared with the patient. During each week of radiation therapy you will also complete a questionnaire about your feelings about the Hatha Yoga sessions. You will be asked to list what you liked or disliked what you found most and least useful and how you would rate the instructor. You will also be asked about how often you practice outside of class and if you think you are benefitting from the Hatha Yoga program. It should take about 5 minutes to complete this questionnaire. Questionnaires for All Study Participants: You will complete about 10 questionnaires before the patient's first radiation treatment at the end of the treatment (usually 6 weeks later) and then again 3 months later. The questionnaires have questions about your mood your quality of life your feelings about being a caregiver and your relationship with the patient. It should take about 45 minutes to complete these questionnaires each time. You will also complete about 5 questionnaires halfway through the radiation treatment schedule. These questionnaires have questions about your quality of life. These should take about 20 minutes to complete. Saliva Testing for All Study Participants: After your first visit at the end of the patient's radiotherapy and 3 months after the radiation you will be asked to provide saliva samples to measure the level of cortisol (a stress hormone). These saliva samples will be collected 4 times a day for 2 days in a row. You will be asked to collect the samples when you first wake up about 45 minutes later about 10 hours after waking and then at bedtime. To collect each saliva sample you will chew on a cotton ball for a few seconds and then put the cotton in a small plastic tube. You will write down the times at which you took these samples. You will then either bring the samples into the clinic or mail the samples back to MD Anderson in postage-paid envelopes that will be provided to you. The supplies needed for this testing will also be provided at no cost to you. These saliva samples will be destroyed after being studied. Follow-Up Phone Calls: If you are in Group 1 after you have completed the weekly yoga classes you will receive phone calls from a study team member asking about your at home Hatha Yoga practice. You will be called every other week between the end of your radiotherapy and your final visit with the study. This will be about 5-6 phone calls and they will last approximately 10 minutes each. Length of Study: Your participation on this study will be over when you have completed the questionnaires at the time of the patient's 3-month follow-up appointment in the thoracic clinic. This is an investigational study. Up to 50 patients and their family members for a total of 100 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson. Patients: If you agree to take part your medical history and demographic information (such as your age sex and race) will be recorded. By signing this consent you also agree that your caregiver will be approached to take part in this study. After your first visit you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of dice) to 1 of 2 groups: - Group 1 will take part in the couple-based Hatha Yoga program. - Group 2 will not take part in the couple-based Hatha Yoga program but will complete the same procedures as group 1. Participants in this group will be given the option to take part in the couple-based Hatha Yoga program (off study) after they finish their last questionnaire packet. Group 1: Hatha Yoga Sessions: You and your caregiver have a 50/50 chance to be assigned to the intervention group or to the usual care group. If you are assigned to the intervention group you will take part in up to 15 sessions of Hatha yoga over the course of radiation therapy (2-3 weekly sessions). Each 45- to 60-minute session will be guided by an instructor. You should attend each session together as a couple. During the yoga sessions you will be asked to do deep-breathing exercises and perform different stretching and movement exercises. The movements are designed not to be difficult and you will sit on the floor or in a chair while you do them. You can move through the exercises at your own pace.

While you are receiving radiation therapy you will be asked to practice at home 1 time a day either with your caregiver or alone on the days you do not have a session at the clinic. If you are assigned to the yoga group during each week of radiation therapy you will also complete a questionnaire asking your feelings about the Hatha Yoga sessions. You will be asked to list what you liked or disliked what you found most and least useful and how you would rate the instructor. You will also be asked about how often you practice outside of class and if you think you are benefitting from the Hatha Yoga program. It should take about 5 minutes to answer this questionnaire. Your answers to the questions will not be shared with your caregiver. Groups 1 and 2: Questionnaires: You will complete about 10 questionnaires before your first radiation treatment and again after you complete your treatment schedule (usually 6 weeks later) and then again 3 months later. The questionnaires ask about your health any symptoms you may be having your mood your level of fatigue your sleeping habits your relationship and your quality of life. It should take about 45 minutes to complete these questionnaires. You will also complete about 5 questionnaires again halfway through your radiation treatment schedule. These questionnaires ask about your quality of life. These should take about 20 minutes to complete. Follow-Up Phone Calls: If you are in Group 1 after you have completed the weekly yoga classes you will receive phone calls from a study team member asking about your at home Hatha Yoga practice. You will be called every other week between the end of your radiotherapy and your final visit with the study. This will be about 5-6 phone calls and they will last approximately 10 minutes each. Saliva Testing: After your baseline visit at the end of treatment and 3 months after radiotherapy you will be asked to provide saliva samples to measure the level of cortisol (a stress hormone). These saliva samples will be collected 4 times a day for 2 days in a row. You will be asked to collect the samples when you first wake up about 45 minutes later about 10 hours after waking and then at bedtime.

The tubes will also be provided at no cost to you. These saliva samples will be sent to These saliva samples will be destroyed after being studied. Lung Function tests: Pulmonary Function tests (PFTs) are part of your standard treatment as a patient at MD Anderson. We will request copies of these as available from your electronic medical records at baseline and 3 months after radiotherapy. You will also complete the 6-minute walking test. The six-minute walk test measures the distance you are able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard flat surface. The goal is to walk as far as possible in six minutes. You will be allowed to self-pace and rest as needed during the walk along a marked walkway. You will complete a 6-minute walk at baseline at the end of radiotherapy and 3 months after radiotherapy. Length of Study: Your participation on this study will be over when you have completed the questionnaires at the time of your 3-month follow-up appointment in the thoracic clinic.

272,2096,NCT02197351,Recruiting,1 BACKGROUND Precursor Lesions Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer and second leading cause of malignant death in the world. It often presents only with vague symptoms of dyspepsia and consequently is frequently diagnosed at advanced stages. Gastric cancer develop in a series of steps beginning with H. pylori infection. 2-4 It induces an inflammatory reaction with the surrounding gut epithelium which is theorized to drive a subsequent progression in some patients to mucosal atrophy intestinal metaplasia dysplasia and finally gastric adenonocarcinoma. Systematic biopsy protocols In the evaluation for precancerous gastric lesions and Helicobacter pylori experts recommend that biopsies be obtained from the antrum (3cm from pylorus) body (8cm from the pylorus) and insisura/angle. Both the greater and lesser curvature should be sampled. Additionally recently developed staging systems including OLGIM (operative clinic on intestinal metaplasia) scores require histologic assessment (via the updated Sydney score) from two sites (antrum and corpus). Narrow Band Imaging in endoscopy Patients with H. pylori gastritis gastric atrophy intestinal metaplasia most commonly have no visible lesions on white-light endoscopy although endoscopic findings may include antral nodularity absent rugae prominent gastric vessels white mucosal deposits. However the sensitivity and specificity of these gross findings for underlying histological findings is poor. Therefore a number of image-enhancement techniques including chromoendoscopy using mucosal dyes or endoscopy-based virtual chromo-endoscopy (e.g. narrow band imaging) have been proposed. Narrow band imaging is the most widely investigated. Narrow band imaging is an electronic noninvasive technique in which the illuminating light from the endoscope is filtered to enable passage primarily of two narrow bands of light 415nm and 540nm. These wavelengths correspond to the hemoglobin absorption wavelength in the capillaries and submucosal vessels respectively. This enhances evaluation of the mucosal surface patterns and vascular irregularities. NBI has been shown to be useful in the detection of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus and characterization of small colonic adenomas. Recently a simple NBI classification using high-definition white light endoscopy was proposed for gastric mucosal examination.18 The NBI interpretation using this classification was compared with histological examination of mucosal biopsies with both NBI and histology determined in blinded fashion. This classification which defines the mucosal pattern of the stomach had an accuracy exceeding 80% and excellent interobserver agreement (kappa=0.75) for normal mucosa intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia. However the study was done at a referral center where 34% of patients had dysplasia and NBI was not compared with a white light assessment or standardized gastric biopsy protocol. Additionally the results were not provided on a per patient basis which is the most relevant endpoint in clinical practice. 2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE Prompt detection of gastric cancer precursors enables early detection and less invasive treatment options such as endoscopic resection. Narrow band imaging is a completely noninvasive technique which uses filtered light to enhance assessment of mucosa. Our aim is to gauge whether biopsies targeted by narrow band imaging improves the detection of gastric intestinal metaplasia and gastric dysplasia relative to standard white light techniques on a per patient basis. A secondary aim will be to assess whether the technique is amenable to standardization so that it might be used more broadly to identify patients with early gastric neoplasia. While NBI is built into the vast majority of endoscopes in use few physicians are aware of its potential use. 3.0 STUDY DESIGN The study will be a prospective tandem endoscopy trial. All EGDs will have already been planned as part of standard clinical care. High definition white light endoscopy will initially be performed. The specific location of all mucosal findings in the stomach such as ulceration or nodularity which require biopsy will be noted by the endoscopist and research coordinator but will not be biopsied until after NBI. This is done so that blood will not distort or bias NBI assessment. Any abnormal findings in other parts of the GI tract examined using the scope (esophagus and duodenum) will be noted and biopsied. At the completion of the white light exam while the scope is in the stomach the white light endoscopist will press a button on the scope which changes the view to the narrow band imaging. At this point the NBI endoscopist who is initially blinded to the white light findings will enter the procedure room and examine the stomach using NBI. The type and location of NBI abnormalities will be noted and biopsies obtained. At the end of the NBI exam the NBI endoscopist will switch the scope view back to white light mode. The white light endoscopist will return to the room and biopsy any sites identified and recorded during the initial white-light endoscopy. A research coordinator present for the entire procedure will verify and record that all sites identified during the initial white light exam are biopsied. Subsequently random biopsies will be performed by taking 2 biopsies from the lesser curvature (body and antrum) 2 biopsies from the greater curvature (body and antrum) and one from the angle. The biopsies obtained by white light exam narrow band imaging exam and random sampling will be separately coded and submitted to pathology. Histologic analysis will be performed by expert GI pathologists blinded to the acquisition approach. Short 10 second video clips of each site targeted for biopsy by white light narrow band imaging will be recorded. They will be matched with the final biopsy results and stored WITHOUT personal health identifiers. These short videos may be used for training and shared with collaborators to assess inter-observer variability and standardize the interpretation of NBI of the stomach. The primary outcome measure will be yield of NBI high definition white light endoscopy and random biopsy for the detection of atrophic gastritis IM and dysplasia on a per patient basis. A secondary endpoint will be the number of regions found by each method to exhibit atrophic gastritis IM and dysplasia (per lesion (region) yield). The yields of H. Pylori by method and the total number of biopsies guided per method will be additional outcomes. Patients will be enrolled at the Los Angeles County Hospital of the University of Southern California as well as the Gastroenterology Unit at the University of Porto in Porto Portugal. The protocol originates from and statistical analysis will be done at the University of Southern California. No personal health identifiers will be exchanged at any point between the two institutions. Prior to the formal initiation of the study there will be a lead in period of 10-20 patients with gastric symptoms. The initial patients will be examined using the white light NBI and gastric biopsy protocol. After this the images will be discussed by the investigators at the two centers to make certain that NBI interpretation of gastric premalignant changes is standardized. The LAC+USC investigators will also review the Portugese video training library on gastric NBI. Any changes in performance of the lead in versus the study will be noted to address the secondary aim of developing a standardized approach to NBI which may help this technique be used widely to identify patients with early gastric neoplasia. 4 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The Fisher's exact chi squared test will be used for dichotomous outcomes such as the accurate detection of the highest level histology and number of biopsies. Adverse reactions will be reported in a descriptive manner. Based on previous research which showed 74% correction detection of gastric cancer precursors with white light endoscopy versus 89% with NBI and given our anticipated gastric cancer prevalence of 20% we performed preliminary sample size estimates for a range of OR using G*Power (alpha=0.05 beta =0.20). We anticipate an N of 200 will be sufficient to show a significant difference between methods.,Gastric Cancer;Gastric Metaplasia;Gastric Dysplasia,stomach neoplasms;narrow band imaging;gastroscopy,2017-12-01,,Diagnostic,Inclusion Criteria: - presenting for upper endoscopy for gastric indications - gastric indications include upper abdominal pain dyspepsia abnormal gastric imaging iron deficiency anemia gastric ulcer management of GI blood loss without active bleeding reflux weight loss.

273,2099,NCT02193672,Withdrawn,"PET/CT Scans: If you are found eligible to take part in this study you will have a PET/CT scan at your treatment baseline visit about 1 week before your first cycle of chemotherapy. You will then have a second PET/CT scan at the end of your first cycle of chemotherapy (about 3-4 weeks after starting chemotherapy). For up to 6 hours before the PET/CT scan you must not eat or drink anything except water. A small needle and tube will be placed in your arm and you will receive an injection of a very small amount of a mildly radioactive material into your bloodstream (the investigational tracer [18F]fluciclatide). The radioactive nature of this injected material allows the scanner to ""see"" it in certain places in your body. After the injection you will need to rest quietly until it is time for the scan. The amount of rest time may vary but be prepared to wait for between 45 and 90 minutes. During the scan you will lie flat on your back on a table. The scan itself may last up to 1 hour. Each PET/CT imaging session will last about 4 hours total from the time you arrive at the clinic until you are discharged and allowed to go home. You may be discharged 30 minutes after the scan is complete if the doctor thinks you are clinically stable and it is safe for you to leave. Study Visits: If the following tests are already being performed as part of the clinical research study you are participating in or as part of standard care they will not need to be repeated for this study. Baseline Visit (before the first PET/CT is performed): - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - If you can become pregnant urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. To take part in this study you must not be pregnant. End of Cycle 1 (before the second PET/CT is performed): -Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. About 24 hours after each PET/CT is performed the study staff will call you by telephone to ask about your health status and any side effects you may be experiencing. Anytime within the next month after the second PET/CT scan blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. When your chemotherapy is over you will have a third PET/CT scan as part of your standard care and an FDG tracer will be used for that scan. Length of Participation: Your study participation will end about 6 weeks after your second PET/CT scan is performed. This is an investigational study. [18F]Fluciclatide is not FDA approved or commercially available. At this time it is only being used in research. Up to 50 patients will take part in this research study.

276,2129,NCT02190227,Completed,This prospective clinical trial will determine if the tumor RDA score can predict for pCR after the first second and third cycles of chemotherapy in women with breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapy. Tumor RDA score will also be measured after the first dose of any new chemotherapy agent if residual palpable disease is present. Data will be collected until accrual target of 30 patients is met. All patients will undergo core needle biopsy of the breast tumor and analysis of ER PR and HER-2-Neu receptors. Patients will receive neoadjuvant therapy as recommended by their treating physicians. All chemotherapy regimens will be acceptable for participation in this study. Usually these regimens are between 6 to 8 cycles often with a switch of chemotherapy regimens after 3 to 4 cycles. Evaluation of tumor size will be determined by 2 axis tumor measurement performed prior to and after each chemotherapy treatment. The Tumor RDA score will be evaluated by performing fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies under local anesthetic if the tumor is clinically palpable after the first second and third cycles of chemotherapy. Tumor RDA score will also be determined if palpable tumor is present after the first cycle of any second chemotherapy agent.,Invasive Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer;Chemotherapy;Neoadjuvant;RNA Disruption Assay;Biopsies;Response,2014-09-01,,Diagnostic,Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must be female. - Patients must be 18 years of age or older. - Patients with stage I II or III breast cancer that is greater or equal to 2 cm on clinical examination. - Patients that have biopsy proven invasive breast cancer diagnosed by core needle biopsy - Patients who are chemotherapy and radiotherapy naïve for the treatment of the current breast cancer. - Patients that accept to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy. - Patients with bilateral breast cancer are eligible. - Patients that understand accept and have signed the approved written consent form. - Patients will need to consent to be part of the study.

280,2206,NCT02190656,Completed,One of the main aims when carrying out surgery for rectal cancer is to avoid patients ending up with a permanent stoma. The current standard operation for resection of the rectum is an anterior resection. A large proportion of the patients undergoing this procedure develop anterior resection syndrome with significant alteration of their bowel habit including urgency incontinence and unpredictability. Many definitions for this problem have been used and until recently there was no specifically designed tool for measuring it. There has never been a large scale study in the UK to tell us how common the problem is. A meta-analysis combining results from small studies show marked variation in the frequency of symptoms ranging from 285% mainly because of the different methods of assessment used in the studies. The LARS score was recently developed by a research group in Denmark. Their results show that 45.9% of patients had major LARS at 12 months following surgery. This is nearly half of all patients in their sample and clearly represents an important problem. Anterior resection syndrome is known to have a negative effect on quality of life. It is a multifactorial condition and is increased in patients have chemotherapy and radiotherapy. There are treatments available and also in development which may help patients. However in clinical practice patients are not routinely asked about their functional outcome and the effect that these symptoms can have on patients' lives is often not discussed. The urgent need for further research into the longterm functional effects of treatments for cancer has been acknowledged by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the National Cancer Survivorship Initiative. Determining baseline prevalence in the UK and validating the LARS score will allow accurate preoperative counselling of patients about functional outcomes following surgery for rectal cancer. It will facilitate comparison between populations further helping to determine risk factors and aiding in development of therapeutic interventions. An appreciation of the impact of anterior resection syndrome on postoperative quality of life will encourage routine assessment of functional outcomes in clinical practice allowing identification of patients who may benefit from treatment.,Rectal Cancer,Rectal cancer;Anterior Resection Syndrome;Functional outcomes,2015-09-01,,,Inclusion Criteria: - Patients having had an anterior resection for rectal cancer who are more than 12 months post surgery - Patients who are more than 12 months post reversal of any defunctioning stoma - Aged over 18 years Exclusion Criteria: - Any inclusion criteria not met - Presence of a stoma - Local recurrence of cancer - Current adjuvant therapy - Further rectal surgery after the initial operation - Insufficient written English to participate,All,,18 Years, ,facility:Queen Mary University of London|London|E1 2AT|United Kingdom,United Kingdom,

291,2245,NCT00090480,Terminated,According to 2002 statistics of the American Cancer Society an estimated 203 500 individuals will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 39 600 will die of the disease this year despite all current therapy. This protocol attempts to exploit an approach to breast cancer gene therapy using a naturally occurring barrier to xenotransplantation in humans in attempt to vaccinate patients against their breast cancer. The expression of the murine alpha (1 3) galactosyltransferase [alpha (1 3) GT] gene results in the cell surface expression of alpha (1 3) galactosyl-epitopes (alpha-gal) on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. These epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute rejection response that occurs when organs are transplanted from non-primate donor species into man. Human hosts often have pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies that bind alpha-gal epitopes and lead to rapid activation of complement and cell lysis. The pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies found in most individuals are thought to be due to exposure to alpha-gal epitopes that are naturally expressed on normal gut flora leading to chronic immunological stimulation. These antibodies may comprise up to 1% of serum IgG. In this Phase I/II trial patients with relapsed or refractory breast cancer will undergo a series of four intradermal injections with a vaccine composed of irradiated allogeneic breast cancer cell lines (HAB-1 and HAB-2) that have been transduced with a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based retroviral vector expressing the murine alpha (1 3) GT gene.

310,2348,NCT00093652,Terminated,OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin when administered with gefitinib and radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction. (Phase I) - Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II) Secondary - Determine time to tumor progression and median survival in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine quality of life in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a phase I open-label dose-escalation study of oxaliplatin followed by a phase II study. - Phase I: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 15 and 29. Beginning on day 1 patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients also receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-365. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity Approximately 3-6 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy patients are evaluated. Some patients undergo surgical resection* and possibly receive a second course of oxaliplatin (IV over 2 hours on days 1 15 and 29) 4-8 weeks after surgery. If surgery is not indicated some patients may receive an additional course of oxaliplatin. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Patients receive oxaliplatin gefitinib and radiotherapy as in phase I at the MTD. Some patients then either undergo surgical resection* and/or begin a second course of oxaliplatin as in phase I. NOTE: *Oral gefitinib is discontinued ≥ 7 days before surgery and is restarted when the patient has recovered. Quality of life is assessed at baseline 5-6 weeks and then every 2-3 months for 1 year. Patients are followed every 2-3 months for 1 year.

321,2417,NCT00096291,Completed,OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine whether tumors in women with palpable invasive breast cancer with wild type p53 are more sensitive to doxorubicin than to paclitaxel when given as sequential single-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. - Determine whether tumors with inactivated p53 are more sensitive to paclitaxel than to doxorubicin when given as sequential single-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy in these patients. Secondary - Correlate other biological markers (physiological and molecular) with tumor response in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine changes in these biological markers during and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in these patients. - Compare breast MRI in terms of assessing tumor response with physical exam mammogram and ultrasound in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine whether there are MRI indicators (e.g. tumor morphology or lesion enhancement) that are predictive of response in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor size (> 5 cm vs ≤ 3-5 cm) and presence of palpable regional lymph nodes (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. All patients undergo biopsy bilateral mammogram MRI ultrasound blood marker molecular (gene microarrays and functional p53 status) and physiologic studies before initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Some of these studies are repeated after completion of treatment with the first chemotherapeutic agent and after completion of treatment with the second chemotherapeutic agent as outlined below. - Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin IV on days 1 15 29 and 43. Patients with no residual tumor (indicated by clinical evaluation and radiologic studies) after completion of doxorubicin undergo definitive surgery. After surgery patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 8 15 22 29 36 43 50 and 57. Patients with residual tumor > 2 cm after completion of doxorubicin undergo 8-12 core needle biopsies. Patients with residual tumor < 2 cm after completion of doxorubicin undergo 4-6 core needle biopsies. After core needle biopsies patients receive paclitaxel as above. - Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 8 15 22 29 36 43 50 and 57. Patients with no residual tumor (indicated by clinical evaluation and radiologic studies) after completion of paclitaxel undergo definitive surgery. After surgery patients receive doxorubicin IV on days 1 15 29 and 43. Patients with residual tumor > 2 cm after completion of paclitaxel undergo 8-12 core needle biopsies. Patients with residual tumor < 2 cm after completion of paclitaxel undergo 4-6 core needle biopsies. After core needle biopsies patients receive doxorubicin as above.

The effects of oxaliplatin and capecitabine on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because cytotoxic agents are known to be teratogenic women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study she should inform her treating physician immediately. 9.

Patients must have discontinued coumadin for 7 days before initiating therapy. 12. No prior malignancies (excluding non-melanomatous skin neoplasms) over the past 5 years. 13. HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from this study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with capecitabine or oxaliplatin. This exclusion is for patient safety since patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy and because very few HIV-positive anal canal cancer patients are seen at this institution. This hinders us from accruing enough patients to adequately test the safety of this regimen in this population. 14. Patients with symptomatic pulmonary fibrosis.,All,,16 Years, ,facility:M. D.

326,2448,NCT00098085,Completed,Antigenics is enrolling patients in a Phase II study testing the feasibility to derive an autologous investigational vaccine (HSPPC-96) from the tumor tissue of patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer. All patients will undergo surgery to remove the tumor and will be followed for recurrence and overall survival. The primary goal of this trial is to determine if HSPPC-96 can be made from the tumor tissue of patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer. The secondary goals are to further characterize the safety and efficacy profile to evaluate disease recurrence in patients receiving and to evaluate overall survival in patients receiving HSPPC-96. HSPPC-96 is an investigational immunotherapeutic agent made from an individual patient's own tumor which is collected at the time of surgery. A portion of the tumor tissue is sent to Antigenics' manufacturing facility where it will undergo processing to create a vaccine. This vaccine may help the patient's immune system attack cancerous cells while leaving healthy cells alone.,Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma;Lung Cancer;Pulmonary Cancer,Lung cancer;Non-small cell lung cancer;Pulmonary;Immunotherapy;Vaccine,,,,This is a summary of criteria.

345,2548,NCT00090961,Terminated,OBJECTIVES: - Compare improvement in physiologic function in terms of exercise tolerance in patients with inoperable locally advanced lung cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy and randomized to pulmonary rehabilitation comprising education with vs without supervised exercise training. - Compare the health-related quality of life in terms of multidimensional functioning and patient perception of respiratory difficulties in patients undergoing these pulmonary rehabilitation interventions. OUTLINE: This is a randomized multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Zubrod performance status (0-1 vs 2); FEV_1 (≥ 70% of predicted vs < 70% of predicted); and smoking status* (never smoked or former smoker vs current smoker). Approximately 20 weeks into treatment on SWOG-S0023 patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms. NOTE: * Never smoked is defined as < 100 cigarettes in a lifetime and former smoker is defined as no smoking for ≥ 1 year. - Arm I: Patients participate in a supervised structured exercise program (i.e. walking on a treadmill OR using a stationary exercise bicycle) 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Patients also receive educational materials on how to improve breathing and conserve energy. - Arm II: Patients receive educational materials as in arm I. In both arms patients undergo exercise testing using 6-minute walks to measure exercise tolerance at initial evaluation (after randomization but prior to intervention) 12 weeks and then at 6 and 9 months. In both arms intervention continues in the absence of disease progression or the development of other medical conditions that would preclude study participation. Quality of life is assessed at baseline 12 weeks and then at 6 and 9 months.

351,2581,NCT00099086,Active  not recruiting,Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Docetaxel may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs such as leuprolide goserelin or bicalutamide may stop the adrenal glands from making androgens. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy and hormone therapy may kill more tumor cells.,Prostate Cancer,adenocarcinoma of the prostate;stage IIB prostate cancer;stage IIA prostate cancer;stage III prostate cancer;stage IV prostate cancer,2018-12-01,,Treatment,Inclusion Criteria: 1.

Secondary - Determine the feasibility of this vaccine in these patients. - Determine vaccine-specific and antitumor immunity in patients treated with this vaccine. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients undergo leukaphersis to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). PBMC are expanded ex vivo to generate monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC). Autologous tumor cells are harvested and purified at the time of surgical resection. DC are then loaded with irradiated autologous tumor cells. Within 4-8 weeks after surgical resection patients receive autologous DC loaded with irradiated autologous tumor cells intradermally on approximately days 1 30 and 60 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 6-9 patients receive escalating doses of vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. If 2 of 9 patients in the first cohort experience dose-limiting toxicity that dose level is considered the MTD. Patients are followed at approximately 1 and 4 months and then every 6 months for 4 years.

367,2657,NCT00097227,Completed,Lung cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed for both genders in the United States. Approximately 173 770 new cases are estimated for 2004. It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women with approximately 160 440 deaths estimated for 2004. Prognosis for many is poor if not diagnosed at an early stage and therapy for advanced disease is limited. The study will test two chemotherapy agents carboplatin and paclitaxel in combination with a newly approved drug called cetuximab which is continuing to be tested in colorectal cancer and other cancers. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody which is believed to work by attaching to an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on tumor cells and thereby blocking tumor cells from reproducing. It is an antibody to the EGFR. Fifty percent of lung cancers overexpress EGFR. Rationale: The present study is built upon the data from previous studies incorporating cetuximab into each of two regimens of paclitaxel plus carboplatin. The results of prior studies using paclitaxel and carboplatin demonstrate that these drugs in combination using a variety of schedules are both safe and effective as therapy for advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The addition of biologic therapy with the anti-EGFR agent cetuximab to the combination will presumably maximize the therapeutic index while keeping toxicity to a minimum in patients with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Research Hypothesis: Subjects with previously-untreated stage IIIB/IV NSCLC who receive a combination of paclitaxel carboplatin and cetuximab will have a progression-free survival rate greater than that previously reported for subjects receiving the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin.,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,NSCLC;non-small;lung;IIIb;IV;Carboplatin;Paclitaxel;Cetuximab;Stage IIIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer;Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,2007-04-01,,Treatment,Inclusion Criteria: To be eligible for the study subjects must fulfill all of the following criteria and have a complete signed informed consent form. - Subjects must have signed an approved informed consent. - Subjects with histologically or cytologically documented stage IIIB (supraclavicular lymph node high neck node or pleural effusion involvement) or IV NSCLC. Disease must be newly diagnosed or recurrent at least 1 year post adjuvant therapy. - Subjects with measurable disease. - Subjects with ECOG performance status 0-1. - Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastasis are eligible; however they must have completed radiotherapy/radiosurgery at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment and be off steroids. - Radiotherapy must have been completed > 2 weeks prior to enrollment and the subject must have recovered from all adverse effects of prior radiotherapy. No previous irradiation to the only area of measurable disease. New lesions that developed in a previously irradiated area will be allowed. - If diagnostic tissue or slides are available for a subject these must be submitted for testing of EGFR status. - Subjects ≥18 years of age. - Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 4 weeks after the study in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.

371,2667,NCT00097214,Completed,Lung cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed for both genders in the United States. Approximately 173 770 new cases are estimated for 2004. It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women with approximately 160 440 deaths estimated for 2004. Prognosis for many is poor if not diagnosed at an early stage and therapy for advanced disease is limited. The study will test carboplatin in combination with a newly approved drug called cetuximab which is continuing to be tested in colorectal cancer and other cancers. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody which is believed to work by attaching to an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on tumor cells and thereby blocking tumor cells from reproducing. It is an antibody to the EGFR. Fifty percent of lung cancers overexpress EGFR. Rationale: The present study is built upon the data from the described studies incorporating cetuximab into a regimen of single-agent carboplatin. Previous data suggest that single agent carboplatin is active in NSCLC. The addition of biologic therapy with the anti-EGFR agent cetuximab to carboplatin will presumably maximize the therapeutic index while keeping toxicity to a minimum in patients with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Research Hypothesis: The population being studied in this trial is subjects with previously untreated Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC. The research hypothesis is that these subjects will achieve a response (based on RECIST criteria) to therapy with the combination of carboplatin and cetuximab.,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,NSCLC;Non-small;Lung;IIIB;IV;Carboplatin;Cetuximab;Stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer;Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer,2007-04-01,,Treatment,INCLUSION CRITERIA: To be eligible for the study subjects must fulfill all of the following criteria. - Subjects must have signed an approved informed consent. - Subjects with histologically or cytologically documented stage IIIB (supraclavicular lymph node high neck node or pleural effusion involvement) or IV NSCLC. Disease must be newly diagnosed or recurrent at least 1 year post adjuvant therapy. - Subjects with measurable disease. - Subjects with ECOG performance status 0-1. - If diagnostic tissue or slides are available for a subject these must be submitted for testing of EGFR status. - Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastasis are eligible; however they must have completed radiotherapy/radiosurgery at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Radiotherapy must have been completed >2 weeks prior to enrollment and the subject must have recovered from all adverse effects of prior radiotherapy. No previous irradiation to the only area of measurable disease. New lesions that developed in a previously irradiated area will be allowed. - Subjects ≥18 years of age. - Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 4 weeks after the study in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.

384,2760,NCT00095927,Completed,Amifostine is a drug that is used to treat moderate to severe xerostomia (dry mouth) for those who receive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. It was approved by the FDA for use intravenously. This study plans to examine the effects of xerostomia when Amifostine is used subcutaneously (by injection). Amifostine has been seen to be effective when used to combat the effects of dry mouth but also has some side effects which are listed later in this consent form. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of twice a day radiation therapy given with chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and paclitaxel (Taxo 1).

393,2804,NCT00094562,Completed,The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nutritional supplementation with fish oils to maintain weight in patients with disease-related weight loss (cachexia). Weight loss commonly results in a poorer prognosis functional status and quality of life. Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with cachexia mainstream treatment does not sustain weight and although nutritional supplements are commonly used many of these have not been tested in clinical trials. Recent work in cachexia has revealed that this is mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. There are data that suggests that fish oils can affect the underlying pathogenic inflammatory response and have an affect on weight maintenance and nutritional balance Diseases in which cachexia is most common: - Cancer - Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) - Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Goals of the Study: - To evaluate the safety and efficacy of fish oils vs. corn oil in the maintenance of weight and lean body mass in patients with disease-related weight loss. - To understand the mechanism of fish oil effect on health maintenance by evaluating the anti-inflammatory anti-catabolic anti-oxidant and anabolic actions of these compounds - To document the effect of our interventions on quality of life and functional status. Study Outline: Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either fish oil supplements or corn oil for the duration of this 3-month study. Participants will have five study visits and two telephone interviews. During each study visit participants will undergo laboratory tests a physical exam and a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) bone scan. Participants will be asked to keep a food diary during the study. During the telephone interviews participants will be asked health-related questions and discuss their current functional status.,Cancer;Cancer Cachexia;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease;Chronic Heart Failure;Rheumatoid Arthritis,Cancer;Cancer Cachexia;Weight Loss;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease;Chronic Heart Failure;Rheumatoid Arthritis,2007-09-01,,Treatment,Inclusion Criteria: - Men and Women with disease-related weight loss e.g. cardiac cachexia COPD CHF RA. - All stages of Pancreatic cancer patients (No weight loss requirements) - All stages of cancer with 5% weight loss - At least 6 weeks post-surgery - On a stable dose of medications for at least 6 weeks prior to study entry - Most recent ECOG Performance status score of 0 1 2 or 3 if applicable - Agree to use acceptable methods of contraception during the study and for 3 months after study completion for female participants.

394,2809,NCT00090545,Completed,BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) is a potent inhibitor of wild-type and mutant b-Raf and c-Raf kinase isoforms in vitro. In addition this agent also inhibits p38 c-kit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR-beta) affecting tumor growth as well as possibly promoting apoptosis by events downstream of c-Raf. At this time over 500 patients have been treated with this drug with tolerable side effects. The primary objective of this study is to determine if BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) is associated with a 50% 4 month probability of progression free survival in patients with metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC) as determined by clinical radiographic and prostatic specific antigen (PSA) criteria. The secondary objective of this study will be demonstration of biologic effect by the drug in the patient and on the tumor (when possible). Correlative studies will be conducted on serially obtained tissue biopsies bone marrow biopsies and white blood cell collections. These laboratory correlates will include elucidation of activation of components of the Raf-extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)-methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and angiogenesis pathways using protein microarray technologies developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)/Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clinical proteomics program. Per Amendment D a secondary objective of this study will also be to determine the time to progression measured by clinical and radiographic criteria. The 22 patients treated on the first stage of this protocol will be retrospectively evaluated with respect to this secondary endpoint possible. Please refer to the statistics section for further details. The combination of correlated clinical and laboratory endpoints with emphasis on molecular signaling will provide new information on the anti-tumor effects helping to characterize its role in the treatment of androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC).,Prostate Cancer,Hormone-Refractory;Proteomics;Angiogenesis;VEGFR;Prostate Cancer;Metastatic Prostate Cancer,2009-04-01,,Treatment,- INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients must have histopathological confirmation of prostate cancer by the Laboratory of Pathology of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) or Pathology Department of the National Naval Medical Center prior to entering this study. Patients whose pathology specimens are no longer available may be enrolled in the trial if the patient has a clinical course consistent with prostate cancer and available documentation from an outside pathology laboratory of the diagnosis. In cases where original tissue blocks or archival biopsy material is available all efforts should be made to have the material forwarded to the research team for use in correlative studies. Patients must have metastatic progressive androgen-independent prostate cancer. There must be radiographic evidence of disease after primary treatment with either surgery or radiotherapy that has continued to progress despite hormonal agents. Progression requires that a measurable lesion is expanding new lesions have appeared and/or that prostatic specific antigen (PSA) is continuing to rise on successive measurements. Patients on flutamide must have disease progression at least 4 weeks after withdrawal. Patients on bicalutamide or nilutamide must have progression at least 6 weeks after withdrawal. Patients may have had no more than 1 previous cytoxic chemotherapeutic line. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) in patients less than 18 years of age children are excluded from this study. Patients must have a life expectancy of more than 3 months. Patients must have a performance status of 0 to 2 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) criteria. Patient must have adequate organ function as defined below: Leukocytes greater than or equal to 3 000/microL Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1 500/microL Platelets greater than or equal to 100 000/microL Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X institutional upper limits of normal Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase(SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 X institutional upper limits of normal OR: Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal. Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy including surgery. Toxicity should be less than or equal to grade 1 or returned to baseline. Hormonal profile: all patients who have not undergone bilateral surgical castration must continue suppression of testosterone production by appropriate usage of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Patients must not have other invasive malignancies (within the past two years with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancers or non-invasive bladder cancer). Patients must be able to understand and sign an informed consent form. Concurrent use of bisphosphonates will be allowed for patients with known bone metastases Patients who require hematopoietic growth factor support (e.g. epogen darbepoetin) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) and other maintenance medications prior to study entry will be allowed to continue their supportive therapies. The effects of BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because Raf-kinase inhibitors are known to be teratogenic men must agree to use adequate contraception (abstinence; hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy (including radioisotopes) within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C greater than 3 months for suramin) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents. Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active infection symptomatic congestive heart failure unstable angina pectoris cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Hypertension as defined by systolic blood pressure in excess of 170 mmHg or diastolic pressure in excess of 100 mmHg. Patients with a history of hypertension that is well controlled on medication will not be excluded. Patients may not be on either verapamil or diltiazem while on study. Use of calcium channel blocker should be discouraged. Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Therefore human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib). Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated. History of bleeding diathesis Patients on therapeutic anticoagulation are at increased risk from bleeding while on BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib). Prophylactic anticoagulation (i.e. low dose warfarin) of venous or arterial access devices is allowed provided that the requirements for prothrombin time (PT) International normalized ratio (INR) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are met: PT less than 1.1 x institutional upper limit of normal; INR less than 1.1; PTT within the institutional limits of normal. These requirements will only be made upon those patients on warfarin. INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES Men of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.
